      "I found this proposal quite innovative, it promises something very different from anything I have evaluated so far: placing NFTs and other tokens in GPS locations, with the aim of making it easier for people to pick them up, as the author of the proposal explains. This would generate a very valuable Dapp that would add to our Cardano blockchain a new type of use for NFTs, which is not found so far in any other blockchain and also with the establishment of several smart contracts. Perhaps this novelty will attract new users to our blockchain, popularizing it, thus achieving one of the specific objectives of the challenge. Also, this would certainly increase the number of transactions in Cardano, as we are looking for in the current challenge. From what you can understand by reading the proposal, the idea here is for people to pay small amounts in ADA to be in a certain place at a certain time. An observation: what would HOSKY and Nudge be? I would like the author to explain this, because I don't know it myself and I believe that other CAs may also be unaware of this part of the proposal, which compromises the full understanding of the project. It is quite positive how the author places us with practical examples of the application of his project, that is, we understand, through the areas he cites (business advertising, donations to charity based on location, etc.) Such areas are extremely detailed and argued, so that we can understand very well how this application would take place in practice. In addition to the two main areas, the author also cites other examples of application of his project, that is, it expands our horizons. Another positive point is that the author clarifies where these applications would be used (one application for computer and one for mobile). It also establishes possible difficulties and challenges, which demonstrates preparedness in dealing with adversity. If this works out, it will certainly be a big step for Cardano to become popular in several aspects, fully achieving what is sought in the challenge. \n",
      "\n",
      "5\n",
      "\n",
      "The author starts this session by talking about which applications would make up the whole project (2 front-end applications, a back-end and smart contracts) and explaining how each one of them would be built and work, in addition to the technologies used specifically. Then he focuses on the script: it is explained which activities would be developed each month, and not only that, but also the weekly division of occupations. That way, we have a solid view of what's to come, fully understanding the process. For me, he leaves nothing to be desired in terms of explaining the development of the project. As much as it is an extremely technical proposal, it is possible for all audiences to understand (at least the basis) of what will be done and when. Regarding the budget, we see that it is divided into two parts: for the payment of the professionals involved and the expenses of the day of the event. It is also possible to understand with complete clarity how the requested money would be used, and I sincerely think it is a fair value for the complexity of the project and the tasks to be carried out. And finally, as far as the knowledge of the team is concerned, from what I understand, we only have information about the leader, Dmitry Shibaev. About him, we know his role in the project and a long professional history is detailed, duly proven through the various links attached. However, I missed the knowledge of the other team members. Who are they, what are their resumes? This is the only part that I believe needs to be improved, because we know that there are several professionals involved, and we need to know each one of them in depth. \n",

      "The author lays out many ways to audit the project. Starting with the aforementioned KPIs, we know what specific objectives are expected here, and which relate to different areas of the proposal, not just one front. With this, is it possible to accurately monitor whether success is being achieved, that is, are the expected results actually being achieved? He also claims that the application will be tested in a real-world event (a cycling event), so it is possible for members of the Cardano community who live in that location to participate in the event and bring feedback to the rest of us, in practice. . The author goes on to explain how the success of the project would be, setting many objectives. There's no shortage of ways to check the results here! In addition to the final product, it is also possible for the Cardano community to follow the progress of the project, that is, its development, its construction process, through the very detailed script that was presented to us. A team could be assembled, which would be responsible for the close monitoring of this proposal, bringing to the rest of the community summarized and direct information regarding auditability. Yes, it is a proposal that is completely auditable, the proposal contains more than enough information to perform these tasks. \n",

      "The proposal is perfect in terms of impact. The proponents are to be congratulated because they have created a project that can generate wonderful results for both Africa and Cardano, and I will explain why. The heart of the project can be understood in the following excerpt: “Scholarship/Grant platform based on Ethiopia’s Atala Prism, enabling safe, low-cost and conditional donations for students”. This is the idea. This will certainly benefit Africa, as it will allow financial donation in the form of scholarships to students who, as the proponents themselves say, contain potential but unfortunately do not have the means by which to exploit it. These students often do not have the basic conditions to eat properly, let alone study. Donors often fail to donate out of distrust of how these funds will be used, and hosting such information on the Cardano blockchain will make it tamper-proof, transparent and fully trusted, which can easily boost the number of donations made. And once such students receive the scholarships (if they are not fulfilling their basic obligations, the rest of the money can go back to the donor, which is very positive, as it is a way of guaranteeing to those who donate that their money will not be invested in vain), they will be able to devote themselves properly to their studies; perhaps, they will be able to enter college and have a dignified professional life, and they will always be grateful to Cardano for having been a way to make all this a reality. If the project succeeds, it will certainly popularize our blockchain across the continent, it will be seen with good eyes, and this will increase the number of investors in Ada, new people will be interested in participating in the community, people from the tech area may consider studying our programming languages ​​and work on our project, the number of transactions on Cardano's blockchain will certainly grow, in short, I only see advantages here. The team seems so aware and prepared for this project that they also establish what would be the possible risks to be faced, and some solutions that could be applied to each situation, which demonstrates a lot of maturity and reality in relation to the context and the problems that can happen. on here. Anyway, I think that this project has everything to succeed and most likely will have an extremely positive impact for Africa and Cardano, perfectly meeting the objectives of the challenge. \n",

      "The script is very good, we know what would happen and approximately when, in this way it is quite possible to understand the project development process. Some activities could be more detailed and the time division could be more exact, for example phase two would be from March to July. But what specifically would happen in March, in April, in May and so on? If this division were more exact, we could understand even better how this process would happen. However, his explanation is still much better than most projects, proponents are concerned with detailing various activities that would be developed in each phase. Regarding the team, I think they are extremely qualified people, based on their CVs, this can be concluded. It would be interesting for all members to have a link to their social networks, or in the case of those who are part of the universities, their profile could be attached on their websites, in short, some way of verifying the information that is said, as in the case of Johannes Haushofer, for example. It would also be better if the proponents explained who would do what in the project, this is not so clear, we don't know which people would be responsible for which activities. This is always important to know, especially in a complex project with such a large team. Regarding the budget, we have very detailed explanations on how the total amount would be divided, the parts into which it is divided are very well explained, including for example how many hours the professionals involved would work on the project. Therefore, in my view, the feasibility of the proposal is fully in line and conveys security as to what will be done, by whom and for how much investment. \n",

      "The auditability of the project is great, but it can improve a little in terms of the final results, I think. Regarding the partial results, that is, the project development process, the team would make updates available in Notion, so this part is fully auditable, it is enough that some members of the Cardano community are in charge of carrying out this monitoring periodically. This can be done weekly, every 15 days... Open Notion, browse through it until we find updates that can tell us where the stages of this project are. Regarding that, I think that's all right, that there's nothing to suggest. However, about the final result: from what I understand the funding requested now would be enough to cover phase 2 of the project, only. It would be necessary that, as was done by Notion on the carriage floor, let's say, the team also needed to establish a solid bridge with the community. This could suitably be done through video calls, I imagine, whereby some members of the Cardano community (preferably the same ones who audited the process through Notion) meet with project representatives to understand what the results have been so far. I think that there is no other way to measure the impact of this proposal, because, as it is said, it would not correspond to the project as a whole, so we can measure those commonly used statistics such as: number of Ada purchased, number of digital wallets created, NFTs brothers-in-law, etc. In this case, the final results of the project would be, in my opinion, to analyze whether the scholarships were actually awarded, if the students were making good use of them and what were the results of this investment in their academic lives (in the long term, it could even be analyzed whether they became members of the Cardano community). However, I think that this cannot be evaluated at the moment, being auditable content for when the last phase ends. Therefore, the only way I understand to understand if this phase was successful is to inform the team directly, and they do not suggest this, so it would be an improvement that I could suggest for the auditability of this proposal. \n",

      "This proposal is certainly in line with the objectives of the challenge and I also believe that it is under the command of a very competent group, which has shown in practice that it is capable of successfully carrying out projects related to the Cardano ecosystem. This is the LidoNation group, which already has a library with a lot of content about Catalyst, whether introductory content or posts about the structure of a good proposal; as described here, they also foster debates about Cardano on Twitter, obtaining a very considerable audience (about 100 people a day). The proposal in question is to expand the content that they are already creating, through the creation of new formats and subjects that involve Catalyst and Cardano. I think one part of the breakdown that pretty much sums up what they intend to do is: “Include a new article format by conducting interviews with other Project Catalyst participants in various roles. We will publish these interviews as condensed articles. Through our participation in previous Catalyst rounds, we have built a solid network of Cardano connections with a variety of backgrounds, so we definitely have people we can reach out to for interviews.” That is, they will promote the greatest connection between people who participate or have participated in Catalyst, which in my view is a very innovative way (I haven't seen this suggested before in proposals) to help new members understand this vast and complex ecosystem. They also intend to create a small podcast, officially hire a developer for the site and take other steps forward in relation to their projects that are already underway and from what I could see they have already had a good success. On top of that, they will develop new tools to teach about blockchain and also spread the values ​​of Cardano, because, despite the Cardano project being mainly economic, it also has a human bias. In general, I think the idea fits perfectly with the objectives of the challenge, as it will expand a project already underway, which helps new people to understand well what Cardano, Catalyst is and how to get involved in this universe. What we are looking for here is just that, new ways to add active members to the community, who not only own Ada but also participate in the various activities and opportunities provided in our ecosystem. \n",

      "The proposal's script is not conventional, but in the end, the proposers deliver what is necessary for us to know with solidity how the development process of this project will take place. At first, they objectively inform us what will be done in the first 3 months and then until the 6 months of the project. If they had stopped there, I would say that it would be preferable for the explanations to be backed up each month, that is, it would be better for them to define what activities are being planned each month to be done, not each quarter. However, they provide further explanation, inform us about the milestones they are aiming to achieve and also how each front of the project will work to achieve their goals, being these fronts: “Articles, Twitter Spaces, Lido Minute Micro-Podcast/video, redesign website and Twitter Marathon”. Therefore, I consider that we are very well situated in relation to the project development process, as we know exactly what will happen so that every little thing is achieved, what necessary activities are coming. Regarding the budget, approximately 8 thousand dollars are measured, which in my opinion is a very fair value for the scale and impacts that this project is likely to generate. The total amount is divided into some parts, namely: the creation of new articles, preparation and posting of content on twitter, creation of the podcast and the last part that I did not fully understand but I believe it is focused on design. The values ​​of each of these parts are explained in a satisfactory way, although they are not as detailed, we were able to have a good understanding of how this funding will be used. Finally, let's talk about the team, we don't need to be afraid that they won't work with motivation and won't deliver the positive results to us because they are already developing many materials about Cardano, they have already shown service in five proposals that were previously funded, therefore, a lot of confidence in the team is conveyed right away. However, to further reinforce this trust, they attach a small explanation of who they are and also their linkedin profiles, so that we have concrete proof of the information that is said. So I think in this part of the project we really don't have anything to worry about. In general, the feasibility of the project is excellent, deserving maximum marks. \n",

      "Regarding the auditability of the project, the proponents explain how each of the parts of the whole can be audited. In these explanations they say how far along the project is, but I still feel it could be clearer if somehow they will update the Cardano community with regular feedback or if we should go after such information (which I don't think is a good idea given the amount of proposals funded on Catalyst and the need to audit them all. I think the team should prepare monthly reports and make them available in a direct and simple way to the Cardano community. That way, it would be enough to access these reports and check which ones progress was made that month. Ideally, these reports would contain not only partial results but also a small description of the work routine of all professionals involved in the project, whether they faced any difficulties, etc. Regarding the results At the end, they describe several of their goals, but as I commented on the progress, I would like it to be clearer as to how the Cardano community could verify whether such things have come true or not. As there is a greater amount of information, I think it would be appropriate for a meeting to be held, it could be after Town Hall, in specific rooms to monitor the auditability of the projects. At this meeting, team members could expose to the community how the advances are being perceived, whether articles, podcasts and twitter spaces were launched, and also inform the approximate amount of new community members from all this. It would be very interesting if some of them could participate in this meeting, reporting their experience and how the project helped them to get to know and understand the Cardano ecosystem; they could also inform what activities they are currently involved in, how they are operating within the community. In summary, my opinion is that it is a very auditable proposal, it is enough that the bridge between the team and the Cardano community is better clarified. \n",

      "The proponents explain the problem situation very well. Basically, all the solutions being developed in the Cardano ecosystem require the user to have a login and a password. And this can generate several problems: either the person writes down several different usernames and passwords in a file of their own, which is problematic in several ways, as the person can end up losing this file (even if it is a physical notebook) or someone can find it. you and violate your data; or the person automatically saves the data on services such as Google, Facebook and etc, which goes against the idea of ​​self-sovereign identity as it makes our data dependent and tied to some system. In addition, it is routine for people to use the same login and password for different platforms, in order to more easily decorate their data. This is very dangerous, as if these logins and passwords are breached, the person would lose control of the authentication of multiple applications at the same time. These situations are common, and a problem that has been plaguing us since web2 and which unfortunately is being repeated on web3. With that, the solution proposed here is to implement (1) an identification system and (2) an authentication system linked to the Cardano blockchain. An authentication protocol called “cAuth” will be implemented, whose objective will be to “separate the creation of the SSI and decentralize it, at this moment we are investigating possible solutions and will explore future partnerships throughout the development”. The proposal fully aligns with the specific objectives of the challenge, as, as the proponents themselves claim, it will allow a very significant and important use for decentralized identities, intensively promoting the use of Cardano ecosystem technologies and popularizing Atala Prism DIDs. The proponents also explain that the user will be able to create their own SSI as the whole process and documentation will be explained (from what I understand). In addition, users will also earn rewards (I would like to know which ones), which is another factor that can boost the use of this technology. Therefore, I think the proposal is extremely relevant and fully adequate to what we need to push forward in this challenge (the improvement of sovereign identities), deserving a maximum score for impact. \n",

      "The way the script was presented to us is excellent. We know how long the project as a whole will last and what would happen each month. The relevant activities are enumerated, and we have a good idea of ​​what would happen in each succeeding month, that is, our visualization of the process is quite solid. I think the script is already great, but if I were to suggest something, I would say that the proponents could divide the months into weeks, allocating the activities in each of them (this would increase the degree of specificity even more), however, this does not is necessary, it would only be an improvement. Talking now about the budget, a value of 57 thousand dollars is requested, it is not cheap, but this proposal is quite technical and will require a lot of effort and time from highly qualified professionals, so it is justifiable because such an amount is necessary. It is divided into a few parts, and each of them is very detailed in the sense that we know what is included in each item and also how many hours of work would be necessary for it to be carried out, as in the following excerpt “Research - $ 2,000 ~ 40 hours. Research existing authentication and SSI systems, explore opportunities and implementations. Investigate and develop the business model”. As a result, our understanding of budget use is also quite high, in this regard I have no suggestions because I think the money is explained perfectly. Finally, talking about the team, great explanations are given about the members Lucio Baglione, Michał Wojtera and Phil Khoo. We know their professional roles (what area they work in), as well as how they are involved with Cardano and a small curriculum that puts us well on their previous experiences. Their linkedin profiles are also provided, so that all the information given is verifiable, and we can also get to know more directly what they have done so far and how they are established in their professional context. Total trust is passed on in this trio. Regarding the rest of the members, who would be the developers of the AIM group, I know the group and I know that they are its members, I know that they developed some essential tools for the Cardano community (such as the CA tool and the vCA tool), with I also trust the work of this team a lot. However, ideally, they should also be presented in a very specific way, as the trio of professionals mentioned above were, so that CAs and readers who don't know them can also have such confidence.

      "The auditability of the process is very much down to numbers (“Number of Github commits, Number of open/resolved Github issues, Number of Github PR reviewed/merged/accepted, Number of feedback received and implemented”). Some of this data, such as the issue of feedbacks, could be better explored. After all, both qualitative and quantitative analysis must be carried out. It would be important for the proponents to inform the IOG coordinators (as I believe they will do in the standard meetings) and the members of the Cardano community about the advances, the partial results. Building a bridge with the community is very important, in addition to checking the repository on github, it would be interesting if more ways of auditing the process could be explored together with our community members. I suggest that, at the end of each month, the proponents make an overview, containing, in addition to the goals achieved (the deliverables that they mention in the feasibility), also how their work routines were and if everything went as planned. These reports can be made available in a simple document that should be made known to the Cardano community through any of our various means of communication, such as telegram, discord, etc. Now talking about the end results, the proponents outline a very palpable scenario (“delivery of the two parts of this project. First, a simple proof-of-concept SSI solution that offers a form of DID. Second, the implementation of the DID in a community authentication system, etc etc...”). The question is: how can this be objectively perceived by the Cardano community? I would like them to carry out a survey, draw measurable data that could demonstrate demonstrably whether this scenario has become reality. It would also be essential for us to know the consequences of the project for Cardano, I believe our main metric is to understand whether the use of Atala Prism DIDs has been boosted. With this, we will be able to have a very solid proof of what the project generated. I would say that the auditability is good, but it is not as well built as the previous topics, needing a certain depth. \n",

      "This proposal is positive for the African continent, as it boils down to bringing the Catalyst School to the context there. This new people objective project should insert me in a well-oriented way in the Catalyst process, help as CAs, vCAs, ponents, the initiative has already been voters and etc. a series of activities such as workshops, follow-ups, in short, the group is made up of experienced non-complex people, who help to structure new Catalyst concepts, instructing them on the concepts that should be blockchain, what is the difference between Cardano and other blockchains , what are CNFTs and etc. In short, it is literally a source of catalyst for new members. And if this is adapted to the specifics of Africa, it will certainly be a great gain for its natives. As stated here by the proponents, it answers some difficulties regarding membership in Catalyst. Starting with the fact that most are totally unaware of what Cardano and Catalyst are. Then we have a language barrier, which makes it difficult for everyone who does not have English to attend community meetings (Town Hall, for example), even the mother tongue to follow community meetings (Town Hall, for example), up to the participants' accent account. Africa deserves a special one, it is necessary that the knowledge passed on to these students is so important to our blockchain. Now that he explains that I also think the project will have a positive impact on the continent, he will say that the expansion of our blockchain is perfect for our community. As new participants join Catalyst, the numbers of Ada holders will be added; new digital wallets will be created; more people transacting on our blockchain; with this, we can increase investments in our Dapps; young people in the technology area will be motivated to learn about our technologies, who will become Plutus pioneers, will know if developed with the workforce produced; In short, the gains are many. \n",

In this way, we have a full understanding of what will develop next, what we will build over time so that this project goes from theory to practice. The degree of specificity found here is so high that it will also be useful in the part of auditing the proposal, as I will comment below. Therefore, no criticism to make for this part of the proposal, in my opinion everything is in order. Talking about the budget, the amount asked in my opinion is totally fair and very worth investing in compared to how this project will be beneficial for Africa and Cardano. The total amount is divided into parts, so we understand exactly how it will be used. The level of detail is so good that we even know the hourly value of some things, like the “Delivery of 11 live sessions in English and French”. I don't have any criticisms to make about it either. Finally, analyzing the team, I think there is a lot of security in this team, because we know their names, previous professional experiences and how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem. However, I think it would be interesting if the level of detail provided by them was more egalitarian, we have people who spoke little about themselves, such as Afia Owusu, for example, while others, such as Daniel D. Lezu, provide extensive information. about your resume.

We know very well how to audit the process, the bidders would provide very detailed information on how this monitoring can be done as the months go by. I found the way they explained this auditability really differentiated, it's as if they had left everything as unraveled as possible so that the Cardano community has enough grounding when it comes to monitoring activities and processes. My only suggestion is that they make it clearer how we could have access to this information, otherwise it's perfect. Now talking about the success scenario, we have many numerical indicators to understand if the project achieved what was expected. I believe it would also be interesting if we had direct feedback from the students involved, from the people who were trained through the School's activities. It would be really cool to see the result in practice, new members joining, people getting an extra income working for Catalyst, tech students specializing in our most used programming languages, developers learning about smart contracts and so on. And it would also be perfect if it was made very clear how this could be directly perceived by the Cardano community.

      "I loved how the proponent defends her idea and her argument, right at the beginning, through links that prove the premise that several countries are already adopting the system of decentralized identities. It claims that there is a location in Switzerland called “Crypto Valley”, and that it “serves as one of the most prominent global powerhouses for blockchain activity”. She still argues by means of numbers (how many companies, for example, the local contains, that dialogue with the technologies of the cryptographic world) how interesting it is for Cardano to invest there. I really think that this context is perfect for what we are looking for in the challenge, the author goes on to argue how decentralized identities are a topic of interest and investment in this region of Switzerland, in which even local political actors are mobilized to promote greater knowledge among the population about this technology; this is a very fertile context for the wide acceptance and adoption of Atala Prism DIDs, as mentioned here, the population is already open to this technology and interested in learning about its various use cases. The self-sovereign identity is not something unknown there, but it needs to be further boosted, so that it is fully understood and adopted by a large mass. This disclosure would be made directly by the bidder, it would disclose what Atala Prism is, the differentials of Cardano's decentralized identity compared to other blockchains, and this would be done \"by joining relevant organizations, participating in working groups, giving lectures on SSI in general and promoting the advantages and benefits of Cardano and Atala PRISM technology”. I think that this proposal meets exactly the specific objectives in this challenge, as the proposer would probably address the topics of “participation and adoption growth, portability, usability and accessibility, security, regulation, business models” among others, as described exactly in explaining the challenge. Therefore, I think that this proposal is totally in line with the challenge, it is extremely relevant, the proposer argues very well why this location in Switzerland is strategic to be financed, it explains very well how the current situation is and what it will do to expand knowledge about Cardano there. \n",

I would like more details about the activities that will be developed, some of them don't need further explanation like “sign up and join DIDAS, CVVC and potentially the nascent TrustSquare Blockchain community”; however, others deserved more details, for example: “contact the organizers to provide lectures or participate in working groups” - how will this contact be established? How do you ensure that event organizers make room for her talks, how do you ensure that they pay attention to this project? It would be interesting for the proponent to inform a little about how she would initially present her idea, in order for it to gain space in the desired context. In “Prepare standard presentation on SSI and Atala PRISM”, the proponent could have informed us which topics she will address within these themes, in what order and why, and for example, if some lectures would be directed to a more beginner audience and others to a more experienced audience; how the lectures would be structured, for example, how long does she plan to present the aforementioned contents in an expository way, whether there would be question and answer sessions; it would also be interesting to know how she would captivate listeners to keep in touch, in case they need further clarification if they come to create DIDs; how this target audience will be captivated to become active members of the Cardano community... Anyway, the activities could have been explained more at length, in my opinion, the way the script is presented to us we have a general idea, but not so deep, of what it's coming. Now talking about the financing, 7 thousand dollars are requested, which are divided into some parts, these parts are very well explained. My only suggestion would be for the bidder to let us know what time is planned to be spent on each of the parties, for example in “time spent creating a standard SSI presentation - $1,500” and “time spent attending meetings and group activities of work - $2,000”. In order for us to ascertain whether the asking price is fair, I would like to know how many hours she plans to dedicate to each of these things. Finally, speaking of the proposer, I would like to begin by extolling the fact that she is a woman; we have few women in our community, let alone proposing on Catalyst and taking charge of something so significant and important to Cardano. Allison Fromm gives us a rich and extensive description of who she is, what she has done so far, what her area of ​​professional practice is, how she relates to the Cardano ecosystem (in many ways! she is very active and important to our blockchain, having been involved since the first Catalyst fund), she also makes her linkedin profile available where we can check all the information said.

In the parts where the bidder states that it will provide recordings of its presentations, links to the materials generated from the working group, dates and details of the presentations: I think that this data should indeed be provided, I don't understand why it couldn't be. In case event organizers do not allow the recording of a meeting, the proponent could inform the agenda of subjects that would be addressed, as well as other feedback about the day of the presentation, for example, what was the public's reaction, if they were interested in learn more about Cardano and, if so, through which technologies will be inserted into our ecosystem (in addition to the DIDs, which will be the central issue, of course). I think the proponent could also prepare reports talking a little about the pre-production process of the project, how it was to generate the materials, if she created videos, slides, designs, how was her study routine and preparation to address these complex issues of simple form. Now, focusing on the end results, the proponent claims that success would be “the Swiss blockchain community and the Swiss SSI community become familiar with Atala PRISM and explore the use of Cardano technology for their use cases”. Indeed, this is the main goal, but through what measurable data can this be realized? It would be important for the proponent to carry out a study that objectively points out how Crypto Valley companies started to relate to Cardano after his lectures; which companies she managed to reach; what has changed in their inner workings; how many new DIDs were generated from this initiative; whether the increase in the purchase and delegation of Ada in that country was observed; which other Cardano technologies started to be adopted (if, for example, companies started to carry out transactions through smart contracts minted on our blockchain). It would be important for this entire study to be scored in a simple way and presented to members of the Cardano community; I think the most appropriate way would be through a video presentation, during a Town Hall, or that it be recorded, posted on youtube and disseminated on one of the community's communication channels.

It is about creating a community in Argentina that has scholars, scientists and young people as its target audience, to discuss in a more traditional way (such as through workshops and symposia) non-traditional subjects, such as technologies relevant to the Cardano ecosystem. In my opinion, the idea is correct in several respects. Starting with the fact that the proponent already informs a very specific target audience. I notice that many proposals aim to attract lay people to the cryptographic world, which is certainly necessary for our community to grow, to become more popular. However, it is also necessary to invest in an audience that is already a little more involved with issues of computing, economics, development, etc., and the target audience of this proposal seems to me to be well in this environment. The scientific community needs to wake up to the advantages and differentials of blockchain, especially Cardano, as I believe that our blockchain is very promising but is not yet widely known and adopted. With that, these events would help Cardano to become better known and maybe be used in some projects. Another positive point is that these events would take place in Argentina; We know that in some places, such as Europe and the United States, blockchain technology is already better known and consequently adopted, however in Latin America, Cardano is still in the embryonic process of implementation. In Argente, specifically, taxes and inflation are very high, making it quite expensive to develop research and projects, as the proponent says. This makes me think the following: if the community that produces technology and knowledge there understand the economic advantages of all this, they might be strong candidates to adopt Cardano en masse, since it is quite expensive to develop anything there. During the reading of the impact, I was a little in doubt about the specificity of the project, that is, I was not able to visualize exactly which subjects would be addressed. However, this issue is clarified in the feasibility, it is said that subjects such as “decentralized validation, the mathematics behind a project's tokenomics, smart contract deployment, digital signatures, the PoS protocol and its advantages” will be addressed. Therefore, I totally agree that this proposal aligns with the challenge as it has the potential to popularize the Cardano ecosystem (causing its greater adoption) for a specific community (the Argentine scientific community). \n",

      "Let's focus on the script: it is very rich in detail, but it lacked a sense of temporality and understanding what is behind the events. The activities to be carried out during the entire process are enumerated and richly detailed, so that we understand quite clearly what would need to be done and how. However, these activities are all related to the moment of the meetings, it is not said what the pre-production would be like. The point is that we don't know when such things would happen, and a script, in my view, should contain this information: what will be done, in what way and when. If the proponent had associated dates with activities, I would say that it is a complete script. For example, the first activity, which would be the first meeting, is explained very well, however, in which month of the year is this symposium scheduled to take place? What would have to be developed beforehand for this meeting to become possible? I believe that we have several things at stake, such as leasing a physical space, hiring people for the production team, hiring speakers, defining which topics would be addressed (this is mentioned), whether there would be a coffee break, a time for conversations and networking... Therefore, I think the script is accurate in terms of making us understand what events would be, but not what would happen behind them or how long each thing would take to be developed. Speaking now of the budget, I believe that the asking amount, approximately 9 thousand dollars, is very fair. Several meetings will be held, and as I said, it's not just the moment of the event, many things would have to be worked on before and some after, this generates a lot of expense. Regarding the explanations of this funding, we have some main points (symposium organization (x2), materials and space rental + workshop organization, materials and space rental + organization of the closing meeting, materials and space rental + social media reach and project management). The first three points are divided into small parts, so we understand very well the reason for the asking price for each. My only observation is regarding the last point, which would be the reach on social media and project management, this part does not contain more specific explanations, I would like to know what the marketing strategy would be adopted here and why. Finally, speaking of the team, this part is excellent, we know who the professionals involved are, what their professional areas are and it is also explained a little about their CVs, in addition to their linkedin profiles being attached, so that we can check all the information that is said. There is a lot of confidence in them, mainly because they are from the scientific community, which indicates that they would have a good idea of ​​how to dialogue with the target audience. That is, I believe that the feasibility is good, with only a few points to improve. \n",

      "The proponent gives us good indicators on how to audit the proposal, however I think that in the progress measurement part, we could have a little more qualitative data as well, for example: we are told that to measure progress a series of data would be monitored. They would be: number of registrations and participants in the symposia + number of speakers registered and approved in the symposia + number of participants who complete the 5-day Workshop + many other numbers, I will not quote them all because there is no need, just read the proposal. Anyway, knowing such numbers is undoubtedly necessary, but how could we observe the partial results from a more human perspective? I would like the proponent to have also suggested that a short report be made at the end of each event, explaining how the moment was, how the scientific community received the topics addressed, if some participants explicitly showed an interest in adopting Cardano's technologies in their projects, if they interacted well during the lectures, if there was any moment of integration between those involved (networkin), in short, qualitative data. In addition, I would also like to know how the pre-production process for these events took place, that is, if the work to be done to make the idea a reality was developed on time, in the right way and by the expected people. I would like to know if the two professionals mentioned as a team hired more people to form a team, such as designers and advertisers who would help form the visual identity and publicize the events, for example. So, in summary about the process, it would be useful for me to add to this number a more human analysis of the moments of encounter and also to monitor what was behind the events themselves. Regarding the final results, in my view the proponent approaches success in a superficial way, we know that the bigger goals would be “to develop and strengthen the relationship between young STEM-oriented scientists and the Argentine community of Cardano”, it is said how many scientists are expected that actually engage with the Cardano community (30) and how many proposals are expected to be generated from this project (5). However, it would be interesting to closely monitor those involved in the event, to find out how they absorbed the knowledge passed on, what projects would be born from there, if, in addition to the scientists, some students felt motivated to study about the technologies of our blockchain, as for example on Plutus... Finally, to trace a more specific notion of success. All this information (both progress and final results) must be easily accessible to the Cardano community, the proponent must gather them, for example, in online documents that are posted on some open google drive, in short, some way for all of us to verify these instances. Therefore, I will give 3 stars for this auditability, because I think it is ok but still has a lot to improve. \n",

      "I honestly loved this idea and I think it is very necessary in Catalyst. When I analyze the auditability of proposals, I always start from some basic principles, which are: monitoring the process AND the final results (not only what is the result of the project, but how its entire construction process was); evaluate quantitative AND qualitative data. For example, we have some proposals in this fund that aim to translate youtube videos from established channels that talk about Cardano into languages ​​spoken in India, in the challenge that focuses on that country. An example of these proposals can be found at this link: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398842. When I went to assess auditability, I noticed that the proponent focused a lot on numbers: number of views of the translated videos, number of hours watched, number of comments, etc. Of course, we need those statistics. But that alone is not enough for us to properly audit this project (I suggested that a closer follow-up be done on who was consuming the channel's content, that is, if these people were actually learning, what they would be trying to do with the new knowledge, etc.). As with the proposal I used as an example, the same situation is repeated in most Catalyst proposals. Obviously, numbers are necessary, but they are not everything. And it's great that the WADA team has become aware of this, as they are an already consolidated and influential group in our community, I've evaluated several of their proposals, I've seen them participating in synchronous meetings, I know they already have funded proposals... The idea here is to carry out a qualitative audit of some of your projects in progress, and from the conclusions reached, this knowledge can help other teams in how to evaluate these more human issues, let's say, of their projects. The experience will be shared and will serve as a guide for other audits, so that we can move away from numerical values ​​only. With this, I believe that the proposal fully aligns with the objectives of the challenge, as it will help the funded proposal teams to be aware of which issues are relevant when qualitatively auditing their projects, learning from the WADA team's mistakes and successes, I'm sure the impact will be positive and it will help the auditability process to get out of the box a little, let's say. Therefore, the rating I will give to the impact is maximum. \n",

      "The script is very good, the proponents explain in great detail the tasks that are developed according to the passage of time. These explanations are quite extensive and allow for a complete understanding of the project development process, but I would prefer the time split to be monthly rather than quarterly. Precisely because there are many activities, it is a little difficult to define where one would start and another would end, and if this same explanation were divided more precisely into the matter of time, I think we would have a more detailed notion of, for example, if for a If something happens, something else would need to be completed first, or some activities could be developed in parallel, etc. The amount requested in the financing is approximately 25 thousand dollars, and we can understand very clearly the need for this money. The proponents, as in the script, do not skimp on details, explaining in which parts this money would be divided, each of these parts being quite unraveled, that is, the need for each installment is argued, where all together result in the total value. I agree that it is a fair amount for the size and complexity of the project, not being abusive or over the top, as is often seen requested in Catalyst proposals. Finally, speaking of the team, which here is made up of 2 people, this part is also good. We know the names and a small resume of the people involved, including links where we can see in practice some work they have developed before, so that a lot of confidence is conveyed in their ability to execute the process successfully. I was still confused about the @ made available by Vanessa, I looked on instagram and didn't find the profile (@CallyFromAuron), I believe it is her contact on telegram, but it would be better if the social network was indicated to facilitate our work of researching those involved . Another suggestion I would like to make is about the role of each of them in the project, this is not so clear. If the temporal division is a little smaller, in the period of a month, for example, and these small things were corrected in the presentation of the duo, the feasibility for the project would be all in compliance, but I still think that enough information is provided for us to have confidence that the proposal is in good hands and has a great plan to be executed, so I will give full marks again. \n",

My only suggestion is to clarify more about how all the information, so rich, will reach all members of the Cardano community in an accessible way. Will they participate in a Town Hall to talk about the final results? Will they prepare a form at the end of each month trying to evaluate all the variables mentioned? My suggestion is that an overview be made at the end of each month, to avoid that too much content accumulates, and that this reaches the community in one of these ways: or through a report, with a text summarizing everything, which can be sent by email to those who are registered on ideascale, or posted on a discord channel or in the telegram group “Project Catalyst”. And about the final considerations, I think the most appropriate would be a synchronous encounter, since it would be a lot to be included in a final report, which would probably be too long and people wouldn't have time to read it. Another idea is that this meeting, even if it doesn't have many participants, is recorded and posted on youtube, so that everyone can access it when they have more availability. That said, I think auditability is excellent, as with the rest of the proposal, we just need this bridge between the team + information gathered and the Cardano community to be established in a solid and periodic way. \n",

      "This proposal is based on the idea of ​​a crowdfunding platform where people can resolve conflicts and have their reputation increasingly improved, while a mediator checks that smart contract entries are being made as promised. There is a project very similar to this one that has already been funded on Catalyst, Win Win, I will leave here the links of some proposals linked to this project: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/384436 / https:/ /cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/381595 / https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/384855 / https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/384838https://cardano.ideascale .com/c/idea/368353. In this case, from what I understand, this proposal aims more at auditing smart contracts than resolving conflicts between two people, in this case, the proposals differ. From what has been following Cardano's projects, the Win Win platform has been successful in its activities and this one can be another positive example of how mediation, based on our blockchain, can bring positive results both for users and for Cardano , as it would increase the flow of smart contracts minted on the blockchain, for example. This type of proposal goes beyond technique and represents practical solutions for people's daily lives, while still using the technologies of our ecosystem, thus achieving the objectives of the challenge. I found it particularly interesting when the author explains the functionality of the project through the two sheets that will be coined GR (NOTAS) and SU (SUPPORTS) and how the mediators would act in this process. It's a very different idea, but the direct way it is explained makes it easy for outsiders to understand, that is, I believe that both CAs and voters will be able to understand well the nature and objectives of this proposal. To reinforce the understanding, he also explains how the proposal would work in each of the phases, through examples. As I said before, I think so, it is a high value proposition and one that can greatly benefit our ecosystem if financed. The author also recognizes possible challenges and difficulties to be faced during the execution of the project, which is always positive, as it is better to be safe than sorry, that is, to think about how to solve possible problems instead of just ignoring them. \n",

      "This part of the proposal is good, but there are things to improve. Let's start by talking about what I thought was the best here: the explanation of the script. The authors explain things through phases. Each phase is subdivided into activities, and each activity is situated in a month and year. In this way, we have a very solid view of what is to come and are able to understand the entire process very accurately. Regarding this part, I believe there is nothing to punctuate, it is perfect. However, the following two parts could be more detailed. For example, project financing. The asking amount is very reasonable (10k), for proposals of this size and complexity, it is a very fair funding, in my opinion. We know how each part of the money will be used, part that will make up the salaries of the professionals involved and other things, such as marketing for example. These other things could be better explained. What marketing campaign will the team use to publicize this project? It's a project that will sustain itself based on the users, so if people don't know and embrace it willingly, I don't think it's going to have that much chance of succeeding. In other words, marketing is always important, but in this proposal it is paramount. Therefore, I would like to understand how this part of the project would take place in more detail, how social networks would be used, etc. The authors claim that it will take 3k for maintenance and management fees, but I would like to understand what those fees are. Finally, speaking of the team, I think this part was somewhat superficial, we do know who the people are who make up the team and what each of them will do, but I would like more detail about their CVs and some way to prove the That being said, maybe your contacts on discord or profiles on linkedin. Therefore, the proposal is not bad in this part, but it needs to be better explored. \n",

      "This is the shortest part of the proposal, but I don't think it's bad/insufficient given the data provided throughout the proposal. Here, they talk about quantitative and qualitative data, that is, how many students expect to be enrolled on the platform over time, and also that these students get to know and enter the Cardano community as they learn and understand about us. Such data are objective ways to measure results, but we also have a way to follow the process based on the information provided in the previous topic. We know which tasks need to be performed and which time periods; with this it is possible to monitor if what was promised is being fulfilled in the right way and at the right time. In other words, yes, the proposal is auditable, the authors provide enough information for us to do this satisfactorily, what we need is to organize ourselves and establish a bridge between the community and the team. Maybe some meetings, or the publication of partial results through social networks. It is necessary for the community to act in favor of constant and continuous monitoring. In this way, I will give the maximum score, because although they do not focus so much on auditability, the level of detail of the proposal as a whole allows this to be done in a safe way. \n",

      "The proposal is very relevant and fully aligns with the objectives of the challenge. The idea is to expand the activities performed by the Mediators.ai platform (formerly known as Win-Win) to Japan. A good snippet of the proposal that might sum up what Mediators.ai is “a decentralized dispute resolution platform and marketplace built on the Cardano blockchain. It allows disputing parties to find a suitable mediator to help resolve their dispute in a timely and cost-effective manner outside the court system.” That is, people seek to resolve their conflicts by avoiding bureaucracy and involving blockchain technology in this action, through so-called mediators. The problem here is that this platform has much more scope in the United States for the simple fact that most of the team that makes up the administrators of the platform is from there, so it is much simpler for them to perform activities in an already known system. . It is said in the scope of the proposal that in order to expand this activity to different locations, a study is necessary, because as I have already mentioned, each country has its own laws and its own operating logic. Therefore, the proposal is based on doing such a market study, a research that makes the evolution of the Mediators.ai platform safe. I think this aligns with the challenge because it would help the Japanese a lot, as the opportunity to solve problems in a more transparent and less bureaucratic way would be available to them. Also, it would be an extra income opportunity for those who become mediators. In addition, this project, if successful, will certainly be a good way to popularize Cardano across the country. So both Japan and our blockchain would benefit, we know that it is necessary that all proposals are interesting in order to give return to Cardano. Another positive point that we can take into account is: the team at Loxe Inc. already carried out an expansion in Latin America, so they already have some previous experience with the issue of evolving their activities, molding them in a new context. With this, a lot of security is passed that this new stage will also be a success. \n",

      "I found the proposal script quite simple to understand and very detailed. We know the activities that will be developed each month, they are listed in a linear order and that allows us to have a very solid view of the process. I don't think more detail would be needed in the case of this proposal, so I consider that the development process is already very explicit. Regarding the funding requested, of 15 thousand dollars: the amount is quite compatible with the complexity of the proposal. It is not cheap, but at the same time it is fair in the sense of providing the remuneration necessary for those involved in the proposal to work properly. The total amount is apportioned based on participant salaries (Japanese mediator compensation: $2,000/month + mediators.ai team member as part-time support: $2,000/month + mediators.ai platform location for Japan: US $3,000). I think the only thing I would like to suggest to raise the level of understanding of this part even further is: the hours that the mediator and the mediators.ai support member would work on this project could have been reported. How long in the weeks would they devote themselves to this? I believe that if this information had been passed on, we would have had an even more specific view of the budget. Now talking about the team, there is a lot of trust in each of the professionals involved. We know their names, areas of academic training and professional performance, as well as we have listed several activities/tools/projects that they have already been involved in. They are very experienced people in what they do and also very active within the Cardano community, so I believe they would be very capable of successfully developing the proposal. Therefore, I will give maximum marks for feasibility, because despite the observation I made about the working hours of those involved, I think the information that is attached is enough for us to understand very well what would be done, how, by whom and for how much money. . Not to mention the fact that the proposal is an evolution of a pre-existing project, and that in itself has already contributed a lot to trust that this new stage will work. \n",

      "The auditability of this project is very high. To monitor the process, the team states that it would use a methodology called Agile, I don't particularly know this methodology and I think it would add a lot to the explanation of this issue if it were briefly explained. However, what we are really looking for is for the team to take responsibility for delivering partial results to the community, and they promise to do this through monthly meetings with the IOG coordinators, which are standard procedure in our ecosystem. It would be interesting if these reports were available for the community to consult as well, especially the Japanese public, which I believe would be very engaged with the project. Now talking about the final results, the proponents inform in a very rich way what is targeted in the 3, 6 and 12 month periods. We know the number of institutions and mediators that are targeted, so we have a good understanding of the level that the proponents want to achieve. In addition to such quantitative data, I would like to suggest that after a certain period of funding, when they are already relatively stabilized in the Japanese market, a survey be carried out with those involved in the project to understand two things, firstly so that conflicts would be resolved in a more transparent, secure and faster way. Second, I think it is very fundamental that we understand exactly how this project helped Cardano to become popular in the country in question. Could it be that we are seeing an increase in the amount of Ada in circulation, new digital wallets are being created, in short, was this a way for the Japanese people to understand one of the possibilities of using blockchain technology? I think that if this research were done and delivered to the Cardano community, the level of auditability would grow even more. \n",

      "This proposal certainly fits very well with the objectives of the challenge, because it intends to develop a series of activities that have the common objective of providing a mentoring service so that Indian startups can learn ways to relate to our blockchain and manage to raise initial funds for your projects. The proponent explains very richly what these activities would be, which would be quite varied. The so-called weekly Workshops on “Decentralized Fundraising” would take place, in which educational modules would be produced that are intended to circulate on various social media, such as linkedin and facebook. I found it extremely positive that the proponent informs us of the specific topics covered in each workshop session, this gives us an exact vision of what he intends to create with this program. Generally, when proposals are about promoting events, it is not explained which exact topics would be covered, which does not cause a full understanding of the process. In that case, we know exactly what would happen in each encounter. In addition to these workshops, there would be “Weekly events at the Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces” and “Interactive sessions and training modules in Zoom or Konmaverse (virtual meeting space)”, that is, the activities would not be fully face-to-face, which would allow all Indians who wished to participate in this project would have this possibility, without necessarily depending on being in the exact place where the meetings will take place. We also know what subjects would be covered in these sessions (“mind mapping, Design Thinking, How to write a proposal?, public speaking”), which generates, once again, a solid visualization of the activities that will be developed. Finally, the proponent will promote what he calls the “Startup Idea Festival”, among the startups that participate in the activities described so far. However, it is not very clear what kind of competition this would be, how they would be compared and so on. But overall, I think we have more than enough information to understand what would be done and how it would be done, and all activities are aligned with the objective of the challenge of expanding our blockchain to the inhabitants of India. With this, there will certainly be a double benefit, both for the popularization of our blockchain and for the Indian members of the startups, who would add Cardano technologies to their actions and all the benefits that this can offer. \n",

I was surprised about the duration of this proposal, because there are so many activities I thought the time would be longer, however, the way it is presented to us, the timeline related to specific actions for each week creates a very solid understanding of the process development of this project. So in relation to the roadmap, I have no criticism to make, I can't even say that the activities could be more detailed because all the necessary detail is presented in the impact part, so when we analyze the feasibility of the project we already have in mind how everything would happen. . Now talking about the budget, the “Program Planning and Management Team” part is perfectly explained, as there is a lot of detail, we know who would receive how much and also the value of the working hours of each of the professionals involved. . However, the parts cited first should be better specified. I will explain. For example, in the marketing part, 2 thousand dollars would be allocated monthly for this. But how would this project be marketed? Which dissemination strategies would be adopted in which media would be launched? In the “Idea Showcase Festival Prizes (3 Cohorts) - $3,000 x 3 = $9,000” part, how would these prizes be distributed? How many divisions would the $3,000 value have, that is, how many monthly winners are we proposing? I would like those parts that don't talk about the salaries of those involved to be better detailed. Finally, speaking of the team, some people give more information about themselves than others. Generally speaking, we know the full names and we have the linkedin profiles of all participants. However, some inform in the proposal itself what are their professional attributions, their academic formations and some previous works. When seeing see, it would be ideal that all the participants had informed all this information, in this way we would have more leveled knowledge about all those involved.

      "The proponent suggests that various types of reports be generated so that progress tracking is possible, such as “Weekly Campaign Reports, Workshop Participant Reports, Feedback Report” and so on. I think that if all of them were actually developed and made available to the Cardano community, the auditability of the development process would be perfect, because we would have specific feedbacks for each part of the project (which is quite multifaceted). However, it is unclear how these reports will be made available to the Cardano community. If the proponent intends to create them, surely he has already planned some platform on which he will make them available. But which one? It would be necessary for him to clarify this issue for members of the Cardano community, would he post these reports on our community's telegram and discord channels? Or in online tools, like Miro, which is mentioned in the proposal? If this doubt were resolved, I would say that the auditability of the process was perfectly thought out. Now talking about the final results, the success scenario is that “active participants from India propose in the next Project Catalyst Funds and bring quality proposals that can add value to the Cardano ecosystem of Indian startups”. But how will this be ascertained? I think that in order to analyze such broad and extensive information, it would be necessary for the proponent and his team to carry out a direct survey with those involved in the project, in order to understand how they would be putting into practice the knowledge acquired in the workshops and in the various events of this project. It would be interesting to see in practice some examples of how the statups would be adopting Cardano, as some professionals would be proposing in Catalyst and so on. All this could be researched, the information gathered and organized, and finally transmitted to the Cardano community through a synchronous meeting, after Town Hall, for example. In this way, we would have a very well-perceived and monitored success scenario. Therefore, my opinion is that the proponent was doing very well in the part of auditing the process, but unfortunately this analysis was very abstract in relation to the final results, requiring real improvements. \n",

      "This proposal is very good and fully aligns with the objectives of the challenge. This is an evolution of Dapp Profila, a project that was started through funding in fund 5 (as I understand it). In summary, Profile is a Dapp that aims to provide greater control and guidance to people regarding their personal data, that is, the privacy of their information that is often used by companies to collect data about the person in order to offer products, services, or even get in touch via email sending promotions in an abusive way (beyond what the customer wanted and allowed to be done). This is a common situation nowadays, since basically all companies ask people to accept cookies when they enter their websites, or for example, when we go to make a purchase, they are almost always asked for personal data that companies use unfair way. Profile aims to help consumers understand what their rights are, laws that protect them, in short, manage this data in a more conscious and secure way. Cardano blockchain is used as a ledger where various data is minted, being free from tampering and corruption, and this is very useful for consumers. The example given is that if a person receives 15 emails a week from a marketing company, requests that these emails are no longer sent and after some time, they continue to arrive in their inbox, the customer would have a way of proving that they have forbidden these abusive attitudes were made as this would be recorded on the Cardano blockchain. And if the company continues to do so, he would have evidence if he decided to file a claim or even file a lawsuit against that company. In the case of this proposal, the proposer suggests that an improvement be implemented that would benefit the companies. It would be a response panel, which would allow companies to have an overview of requests, schedules, in short, various information that is minted in the blockchain about customer choices. This would help companies to prove, for example in the case given about the 15 emails, that they responded to the request in a timely manner. In the present proposal, Profila would improve for companies, giving them resources to defend themselves against actions, as I understand it; there must be a lot of customers, a lot of information, many ways of organizing that are difficult to manage, and from what I understand the panel would be a platform that would facilitate and organize all this data for when companies needed to consult them. This aligns very well with the objectives of the challenge, here we are looking to fund Dapps that favor the expansion and wide adoption of Cardano's technologies. Dapp already proves to be a project that is useful and attracts new members to our community, and with this improvement, maybe more companies will be interested in using it, also in understanding more about Cardano and how our technologies can benefit them. Therefore, I consider it to be a high value proposition and could generate a very positive impact for our blockchain. \n",

      "The proposal script starts off great, but then it gets very vague. In the first month, each week's activities are explained, so we have a pretty solid understanding of what would happen early in the development of this Dapp's evolution. However, after the first month, the 2 month explanation is much less specific, we don't know what small activities would be developed weekly, we only know that the designer will produce \"new band panel screens for the application in parallel to the development work\" . But what would this production be like, what work routine would he have for this result to be achieved? How many screens would be produced? Then, the level of specificity gets smaller and smaller, because the other months are explained together, we don't know what would happen exactly in the 3rd month, in the 4th, 5th and so on. We know that during a quarter (from month 3 to 6) the activities that would be developed are focused on “integration of the new design screen of the band panel, continuous development work”; but we don't understand how this process would happen. It would have required the bidder to have kept the time division to a minimum on a monthly scale, so that we would have the same level of detail from start to finish, knowing who would do what and when. Now, speaking of the budget, a total amount of 81,300 USD is requested, which is quite high, but it makes sense because it is a complex project that will require the work of several qualified professionals. The value is duly justified through the salaries of each, we know how many days they would work and what would be the value of their daily work. It would be positive if the proponent had confirmed to us if these daily rates would correspond to a full-time working day, of 8 hours (I believe so, because the daily rates are quite high, but it would be better if the information were better assured). I found the asking value for the gamification developer quite high, 1000 dollars a day... I don't know if this is compatible with the market, if he worked for 8 hours, the hourly rate would be 125 dollars, this is actually a higher value higher than what I usually see in other proposals. However, it is at the discretion of the other CAs, voters and readers of the proposal to decide whether they think the price is fair or abusive. Finally, analyzing the team’s presentation, in general I found this part quite adequate, as most professionals provide a good level of detail about their careers, exemplifying previous experiences and providing their linkedin profiles, on how we can get to know them in a more direct and proven way. However, not everyone does this, like “REMY MERCKX”, he provides very little information about himself, not clarifying what his relationship with Cardano would be (if he has any too) and not attaching his linkedin profile. Ideally, everyone involved would have given the same level of detail about themselves. I think the feasibility is high, but some points could improve. \n",

      "The auditability of progress is excellent. The proponent informs several ways in which the Profila group would keep the IOG coordinators and also the Cardano community informed about the partial results obtained during the development of the phases; I believe they also informed more specifically about their work routines, if what was planned was accomplished by the right people, at the planned time, if there were problems or obstacles during the development process and how they were overcome, etc. Indeed, this team conveys being well aware of the importance of keeping everyone up to date, through the various ways. They would be the Github repository; the “bi-weekly updates to other Cardano proponents via the Catalyst coordinator call”; also biweekly updates to the “Cardano Projects newsletter” via a website (I think it's fantastic that they create a website for this, it shows that they place a lot of importance on the auditability process; reports containing KPIs sent to Catalyst teams (other bidders?) , which they claim would also be available to all members of the Cardano community; in addition, they claim that they will participate in the monthly Swarm sessions, to keep in direct contact with the Cardano community, in case they have doubts and questions about the project. It was the best auditability that I have evaluated so far in this fund, regarding the process and the partial results. Now, speaking of the success scenario, the final results, this part is also very good, first the proponent explains in general what biggest project objective and also what is expected for the specific times of 3, 6 and 12 months in advance. We know that the project aims to improve the experience d the companies in Dapp Profila, which also seeks to attract new members to Cardano, even if indirectly, I which also seeks to promote the continuity of instruction on the use and protection of data for consumers. I think there is a lot of information to be verified, so it would be interesting if somehow all of it were studied, summarized and gathered in an overview, which could be in the form of a final report, a longer participation in the Swarm session or even in Town Hall, so that more people would be aware of what the project generated; finally, some way for the community to become aware of what was done and what results this generated for Cardano, how the direct objectives of the challenge were contemplated. I thought this part of the proposal is exemplary and certainly deserves top marks. \n",

      "This proposal is very different from anything that has been done on Catalyst so far (and I've been here for a while!). It's about creating Dapps that work for connected cars, from what I understand, first located in Germany and then in other countries. It would be something totally new, to introduce blockchain in the automobile universe, and it is a great idea to do this with Cardano, I believe it will be able to attract a new type of audience, increasing transactions on our blockchain and publicizing it, thus achieving the specific objectives of this challenge. It would also be quite beneficial for car owners, as they will have their information minted into smart contracts, in a non-corrupt and untraceable way: their data would remain anonymous. Perhaps the good use of these Dapps also favors the interest of this new niche in the cryptographic world, who knows if they go beyond the use of connected cars and are interested in knowing more about blockchain and even about our ecosystem? One observation I would like to make, however, is about a part of the proposal. The authors state that if funded, “we will cooperate with a car-sharing services company in Germany as a means of implementing a pilot project”. What is carsharing? I would like this concept to be explained, since it is not general knowledge, this would produce a more complete understanding of the proposal as a whole by the CAs, voters and all those who read this project. It is very positive how the authors set challenges to be met here; demonstrates that they have enough experience to recognize the adversities of the area in which they decide to work, whether for example the lack of professional evidence of the people involved or the short time on the market. With that, they already outline solutions, showing a lot of preparation and planning, which will certainly increase the chances of success of the proposal and the impact will be positive and adequate with what the present challenge seeks. \n",

      "The authors explain which tasks would be developed in order to build their final product, and divide them through phases (1.1, 1.2 and etc). Each of these phases has a list of tasks, so that it is quite clear what would happen and in what sequence. What I missed, however, was a temporal notion, that is, understanding how long each of these phases and tasks would take to start and be completed, also in which month of the year they are scheduled to happen and etc (we know that the phase to be funded would take three months, but when would it start)? Anyway, yes, there is a highly detailed script and explained in a technical way but possible to understand; the only question would be to place ourselves better in time and space, but the level of detail is so good and done in such a professional way that it doesn't make this temporal part a big problem, as it conveys a lot of confidence in the process. Regarding the budget requested, I believe that the value is quite fair for the complexity of the work to be performed. It is basically the salary of the professionals involved, as the authors explain, the salaries added together give approximately 11k, and in the period of 3 months this would be an average of 33k (which is requested in the financing). This part of the proposal is very clear and I don't think there is any observation to be made. And finally, about the team involved, everything is perfect! We know that the team is made up of the employees of PeakSoft GmbH; we are told their names, main functions, a small work history and links such as linkedin (in addition to their personal contacts), through which we can verify the information that is described. It is convey total confidence in the team, because in addition to a great degree of detail about who they are, we also know the role that each one would play in the project. \n",

The authors also establish what would be the success and acceptance of the project, so that we can clearly analyze the results. It is also very possible to audit the progress/development of the project, through the highly detailed task listing present in the previous topic. It's very positive when the team is concerned with building ways to audit the project and not just providing information for that, because it's one thing for us (the Cardano community) to go after updates, results and feedback, and another for the team to come up with strategies. of analysis and make them accessible to everyone (as happens here). So, once again, it's very good, I would like to congratulate this team for writing such a complex proposal, but at the same time accessible, auditable, with a very well argued feasibility and impact. Just to reinforce: yes, it is a proposal that is totally possible to monitor through the strategies devised by the team and also through the direct monitoring of the tasks to be performed. \n",

      "The proposal is excellent and aligns very well with the specific objectives of the challenge. It is about evolving a tool that “seeks to integrate the Human Rights Index adjusted to the UN's planetary pressures. This will facilitate the means for proposers to integrate the relevant objectives and KPIs, helping to measure and track the impact that the proposal seeks to achieve.” The AIM group is already known in the Cardano community for developing essential tools for the work of CAs and vCAs (the CA tool and vCA tool), and now they are proposing the evolution of a tool to help proposers to better align their ideas and projects with human development indices. This directly relates to the challenge objectives because it addresses the topic of “developing common tools, frameworks, core infrastructure or proof of concepts” extremely clearly. In other words, the impact here will be maximum for what we are looking for, this tool will certainly contribute to the increase in the quality of the work of the proponents who often know how to explain the technical part of their projects but get lost when it comes to a more human. In other words, as the proponents would say, it is necessary that Catalyst projects (in addition to obviously benefiting Cardano, working towards its wide adoption) can go beyond our community, helping those who really need it and working on solving problems. economic, social, environmental and other problems. After all, Cardano's principles are sustainability and favoring a fairer and better environment for all. And I believe that this is also the core of this proposal. Proposers intend to expand on something that already exists, adhering to the principles already explained here (on the human development index) and will also conduct research in order to better understand a good proposal structure, comparing with what has already been funded so far. Therefore, the impact grade will be maximum. \n",

      "The feasibility of the proposal is very high. We know that the team is competent, as they say, as they have already been financed many times so far and delivered the projects responsibly. About the present project, we know what will be done and when, in a very detailed way. The explanation of the activities is dense, that is, the proponents undertake to attach extensive explanations full of details, so that we can understand very solidly the development process of this project. I think my only suggestion here would be for part of the temporality: the proponents claim that the activities mentioned will be developed from May to August of this year. It would be even better if we knew exactly what would happen in each of these months, with that our visualization of the process would be even more unraveled. I think it's good the way it is, just a suggestion to make it even better. Speaking now of the budget, the amount requested is high but felt with the complexity of the proposal; this is a highly qualified group that would dedicate a lot of time to this project, promoting the evolution of an existing tool and carrying out research on the area being worked on. We know how the money would be divided into small parts, and each of them is well explained, it is said how many hours of work for example would be dedicated to the frontend, backend and API update development parts. In other words, we have a very precise vision of where that money would go. Talking now about the AIM group, as I already mentioned, trust is already passed from the moment we know about their previous work. In addition, very detailed descriptions are attached about each of the professionals involved, we know their names, professional CVs (including links to tools they have already developed) and their linkedin profiles. In this way, 100% confidence in the team is passed. \n",

      "The auditability of the process can be measured, according to the bidders, by the number of users who use the tool and also who share their experiences (eg a bidder who used the technology, was financed and gave feedback to the AIM group). I think these are great ways to see in practice how the desired results are being achieved; I would also like to suggest that the proponents prepare monthly reports, containing updates on the work routine of each of the mentioned months (May, April and etc) and that this document be shared with the entire Cardano community. I imagine that the team will have regular meetings with the IOG coordinators, as is the standard, but in my view the entire Cardano community would have to be able to follow the development of the project as well. Turning now to the final results, the proponents state that the success scenario would be the sum of the previously reported KPIs as well as “the education and inspiration provided to community members using the proponent tool and those receiving funding on Catalyst and in other sources”. I think that all this information, compiled, could be presented at some Town Hall meeting, it would really be an inspiring demonstration of how, with the right organization and structure, the proponents were successful in funding their projects and with that they were able to work towards the achieving your goals. In other words, I think it would be very interesting to get together some proponents and the AIM team to explain (in short, a 10-15 minute presentation would be adequate in my opinion) how the whole process of developing this proposal went and how these proponents were helped and where they are today, how they are executing their projects. Finally, I think the proposal is highly auditable, it is enough for the proponents to make all the metrics and KPIs established by them reach easy access to the Cardano community. \n",

      "This proposal is certainly in line with the objectives of the challenge. The Catalyst School is already a pretty solid group within our community, known for really being the best place for new people to get involved with the Catalyst process. The principles of this project are perfectly summarized in the excerpt “We onboard new members and help improve their skills along the way, in whatever way they decide to get involved with Catalyst: as a Proponent, Community Advisor, Veteran Community Advisor or without any specific role in the process”. And we know how they do it too, through: “live sessions and workshops, 1-to-1 and group support in many different languages, interactive website and other Catalyst-related workshops”. During the description of the impact, the proponents position those readers who are not yet familiar with the project very well, explaining the main topics addressed by the School and how it is currently operating, that is, what practical activities are being carried out at the moment. The proponents also put us very well on the need for the School to exist: Catalyst is really a differentiated type of funding that has its own rules. In other words, the problem established here is that a person, without the proper guidance, usually cannot understand what Catalyst is or how to get involved, where to start, how to fit into this process that for those who are not yet used to it. it becomes complex. With that, this project very well meets what is asked in the challenge, as we seek to facilitate the participation of new people in our community, and one of the ways that anyone can participate in the Cardano ecosystem is by being CA or vCA, for example. So, by making it easier for people who don't understand very well to get involved with Catalyst, acting in any of the roles previously listed, it's certainly benefiting the sum of new members. Finally, I conclude that it is of fundamental importance that this proposal be funded, so that the professionals who make this initiative happen can be adequately remunerated and continue this work, so important for the overall growth of Cardano. \n",

      "The feasibility of the proposal is very good. We know exactly what would be done in practice, as the proponents explain what activities would be carried out on a weekly basis. It is positive that it is already an ongoing project, and the professionals involved already have experience with what they do, so they will not start from scratch at this stage. The proponents state that some adaptations in the development of the project will be made, such as the reduction of the number of workshops, I believe that in order to have more people participate in the sessions and that they can be a little longer and full of content. We know exactly which topics would be covered each week, for example: “week 2 - Submission Phase: 1 x Introduction to Catalyst (After City Council and Swarm Session) and 2 x Proposing in Catalyst (After City Council Municipality and the Enxame Session)”. With this, the visualization of the process is very solid, it is totally understandable how this proposal would develop in practice. Analyzing the funding requested, 17,800 dollars are requested, which in my opinion is a very fair value for the amount of service that will be delivered and also for the number of people who will dedicate themselves to the project. The payment of professionals is also explained very clearly, it is 50 dollars an hour for them to perform various services. The amount of hours each one would work on the project is also defined, that is, again it is very easy for us to understand this part of the proposal. They also define how each part of the whole (management, marketing, etc.) would cost in total, allowing us another angle of analysis for the budget. Finally, analyzing the team, I really think that there is a lot of confidence in the team's ability to deliver the expected results. I think this for two reasons: first, this project has been going on for some time, any and all members of our community can participate in the workshops, in the Telegram channel dedicated especially to School and see in practice that the project is really serious and constant in your deliveries. That is, the team is really responsible and has already proven this in service. In addition, the proponents attach a short description of each one of them, so that we can get to know them individually, know what professional areas they work in and some of their previous experiences. \n",

      "Firstly, it is very simple for us to audit the school's activities just because we are part of the Telegram group they have. Second, they provide a very specific roadmap on what would be done each week, knowing exactly the activities that must be developed and the small goals to be achieved, so I think it is very possible for us to audit the process. In addition, the proponents state that: “We will provide progress reports to the IOG at the biweekly coordinator meetings and to the challenge team at the monthly meeting”. Not enough, they also suggest various ways in which the community can follow your achievements, whether through their youtube channel, the official website or the contact list they provide. In other words, we are absolutely sure that it is possible to safely monitor the tasks carried out in a progressive manner. Talking about the final results, it is very possible that we also understand what success is, as the proponents state various objectives, such as the “number of workshop participants (maximum and average), the number of 1 to 1 support sessions provided and the number of views on our YouTube videos.” I usually say that it is necessary for proponents to force a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the activities they seek to develop, however, due to the nature of this proposal, in order to analyze the quality of the workshops and all the time of service that this group provides, it is enough that we participate in their activities. So, really the best way to measure success is by the numbers, by the reach that the group owes in relation to how many people became active members of the Cardano community and started to work on Catalyst in a guided way. Finally, I agree that it is a fully auditable proposal.\n",

      "Very good proposal that precisely meets the objectives of the challenge. This challenge aims to encourage new people to become a member of the Cardano community, often Ada holders do not know Catalyst or make use of other technologies in our ecosystem, as well as increase the engagement of those who are already part of the community. Despite being a very incredible universe and full of opportunities, the Cardano ecosystem is extremely complex, I say this because I am already in Catalyst for 4 funds and to this day I have difficulty understanding how some things work and how I could participate more actively in the ecosystem, in addition to being CA and vCA. Therefore, the creation of a visual map will, in my view, be a very big step for us to facilitate the entry of new people, and for them to understand in a simpler and more organic way in which part of the ecosystem they fit. It's great how the author of the proposal presents a research to justify the relevance of the project; it is often much easier to learn through pictures than through massive participation in events, workshops, meetings or through reading a variety of long and often complicated documents. I believe so, it is a proposal that interacts directly with the objectives of the challenge, mainly in terms of locating people. Maybe it's not one of the proposals that attracts people the most, but it's certainly one that has a fantastic idea of ​​how to help people orient themselves. If it's already a challenge for young people (I say this because I'm from that part of the population), I imagine it can be even more confusing for people who grew up in the age of technology, don't know very well how to use online tools and so on. It is also very positive as the author seems to be aware of the possible problems to be faced, and with that, he starts to outline solutions, demonstrating practicality and maturity. Therefore, I believe that this proposal will have maximum impact if funded and done well. \n",

      "The roadmap is very detailed, we understand the phases of the project and what small tasks each would consist of, forming a very clear and explored chronological order. The only thing that was lacking was the notion of time, unfortunately the proponent does not say how long on average each of these activities will last, in which months it is expected to obtain such partial results, etc. This would be important for us to have 100% understanding of the process, because we understand very well what will happen and how (for example, he explains in great detail about the contest, what would happen before, during and after, and what requirements would be necessary for participation and etc, as well as possible project extensions); if this were combined with a monthly or even weekly notion, it would be perfect. Regarding the budget, I think it is a very fair value for the project, and it is perfectly explained; we know how much of the money would go to contest participants, for marketing, for documentation and so on. It would be interesting if the proponent explained their marketing strategies in more depth, as people are the basis of the success of this project, and it is necessary to attract them. Regarding the team, I think we would need to understand who the bidder is. He doesn't introduce himself, doesn't claim how he got involved with the Cardano ecosystem, what is his current relationship with it, that is, is he a developer, designer...? It would be important for such information to be included in the proposal, as well as a means of proving it (such as your linkedin profile). The rest of the members would be the winners of the contest, in fact, there is no way to introduce them at this point in the project. But I wish the author had at least taken the time to present himself in great detail. Therefore, the two suggestions I make are: the proponent could situate the script in relation to time and present itself better. \n",

It is a very qualitative analysis, that is, we know what we are expecting and the impacts that this will have on several fronts of the Cardano ecosystem, especially the human one, which is the focus of the project. I believe that this is in fact the best way to audit the proposal, it would be useless to set several numerical goals without understanding how this project would be unfolding for people and what paths it would be tracing. As we have a lot of information provided, I think that if financed, the proposal would be ready to be audited from the first moment, it is enough for us as a community to perform this role. Some members could be chosen to closely follow the project, they could participate in the contest phases and the unfolding of the phases and bring the information to the rest of the community. I think that a partial delivery of results would also be interesting, that is, if we could see how this graph would be born, as the parts were increasing and developing. Finally, everything the author says would greatly facilitate follow-up, enough information is provided to seriously and continuously monitor this project. \n",

      "The idea is excellent and fits very well with what is sought in the challenge. It's about summarizing the Town Hall content into small podcasts about 5 minutes long, and translating that content into Vietnam's native language. I believe in several points that make this proposal a great potential for success, but we are going little by little. At first, I would like to reinforce that this challenge of hubs, unlike the challenge of new members on board, seeks to promote and popularize our blockchain for more specific communities; therefore, translating the contents of the main meeting of our ecosystem into Vietnamese is certainly making this information more accessible to the natives of the country, mainly due to the fact that a very long time (from 2 to 3 hours) will be converted in a few minutes. I believe it is a problem for everyone, not just the Vietnamese, to set aside so many hours in their work and study routine to regularly attend the Town Hall. So this idea corresponds exactly to what we are looking for in the challenge: to make information about Cardano more accessible to a particular community. This objective can be very well identified in the following excerpt, found in the description of the challenge, which talks about what success looks like: “Local Community Hubs across the world where the average person can take part in their own language and with their own cultural understanding” . Another very positive point that I believe will increase the impact of this proposal is the fact that the Vietnamese community is very strong in our blockchain, I say this because I have already evaluated several proposals that said about the country. As I recall, it is one of the places where Cardano has one of the biggest fan base when it comes to its geographic region. Another proposal that can relate very well to this topic is the 2-minute review of proposals for Vietnamese, if memory serves, launched and financed from fund 7. Therefore, we have a lot of evidence that this specific audience should be a target for investments, as once we manage to strengthen a community that is already quite active in our ecosystem, it will be easier for us to win fans in places where Cardano is not so well established, in my sincere opinion. Therefore, I think this proposal deserves maximum marks in impact, the idea is very good and I would like it to be done in several languages ​​(I would adopt a summary of the Towns Halls myself, because between work and studies, it is not so simple attend meetings every week). \n",

      "The script presented is, in my view, superficial. Although the proponent does not divide the activities into very long time intervals (when this is done, it becomes difficult to visualize the process, as there are many activities for many months, so we do not know when each thing will happen, if parallel activities could occur and etc), yet the level of specificity is low. In fact, the time becomes very long from 4 months onwards, where the next milestones are only expected for 8 months. I say this because there is no deep detail about the activities. For example, in the first three months, they are expected to establish “workflow/tools” that help guide the work. What tools would these be? How would they be selected? What would be the work routine of those who will summarize and translate the Town Halls? It is said that from the third month onwards, feedback would be collected, KPIs that would serve as a basis for the team to adapt the work being done to the needs of its viewers. What KPIs exactly are we looking to collect? How would this information be collected? I think the script could be different, if it were divided monthly and all activities were well explained, the quality level of this part of the proposal would certainly be increased. Regarding the budget, the requested value is approximately 17 thousand dollars. This value is explained in great detail, but could still be better argued. For example, we have fixed costs, but we don't know why each quoted part has the amount that was requested. The site operations would cost about 1500 dollars, but why? Who would work on it and for how long? Regarding the cost of the Town Halls translations, I don't think the best way to calculate the final value of each meeting is by the number of words, even though the proponent has made the calculations that the average duration is 2 hours per meeting that approximately 18,000 words would be spoken in this... these values ​​are not easy to check. I believe that no one will count the words, neither the team involved in the project nor the members of the Cardano community. Therefore, the fairest way in my opinion would be to establish an average price per minute. For example 1 minute would cost X in translation, you know? Therefore, I think the financing part could still be better. And finally, speaking of the team, this part of the proposal is really very good. We know the names of each team member (I don't understand about the @, would they be for instagram?), a small resume of what they've done so far, how they relate to Cardano and several links from their social networks, including their linkedins, where we can see their professional backgrounds in a proven way. The only observation would be to more clearly determine who would do what in this project. \n",

      "Regarding the audit of the process: it is mainly based on how many people visited the site, listened to the podcast, how many documents were translated and how the feedback from the target community is being. In my perception these are really the most direct and correct ways of perceiving if the small, gradual conquests are being achieved. However, two things come to mind: first, how will we have access to all this information? How could the Cardano community check these statistics? I think the team needed to make this clearer. The professionals that make up the team actually seem to be highly qualified people and involved in our ecosystem, so I conclude that they know the various ways to share information of this type, such as telegram or discord channels, for example. I also think that the focus here was very much on what was achieved and not on how it was achieved, that is, it is not described how the team's daily work would be audited. It is very important that this is also discussed. How can we know if, within X period of time, the activities were developed by the right people, in an adequate way, if there were any problems, any difficulties with deadlines? How can we resolve the possible impasses that will arise along the way? Therefore, I believe the team should also look for ways to demonstrate how the day-to-day development of the proposal has been. And finally, about the final scenario that is imagined: we know well where we want to go, as the bidder explains in great detail what would need to be achieved in the 1, 3, 4 and 8 month milestones. In my view, the detailing part leaves nothing to be desired in this final part of the proposal, as the proponent makes it clear how important it is to understand qualitatively what has been achieved, and not just quantitatively. My suggestion here is the same, how do we make all the information easily accessible to the Cardano community? Due to the nature of the proposal, my suggestion is that a large final report be made, containing infographics that can visually demonstrate the data studied, and that this be sent either via email, or by telegram, or discord, in short, any platform already used by the community. The bridge between team + data and community must be solid. I will give the maximum score for auditability because I believe that the bidder was concerned and explored very well ways to monitor this project, just make them more accessible to all members of our ecosystem. \n",

      "This proposal is fully aligned with the objectives of this challenge, because the idea is that a group of active members of our community, called the Catalyst Audit Community, reorganize and intensify their activities around the monitoring of winning proposals from the funds. According to what has been said, this group is already active, but with this challenge some improvements will be proposed in its performance, so that they will form a new way of organization (The Catalyst Audit Circle). We can directly understand the activities that will be developed in the part of the proposal “The Catalyst Audit Circle is tasked with”. Following this sentence, the proponents explain that they will be the ombudsman for issues related to auditability, emphasizing the issue of reports, and will also “Coordinate and collaborate with the community to investigate and develop potential solutions to audit issues”. In other words, the proposal is fully focused on what we are looking for in this challenge, which are faster, more reliable and transparent ways to audit Catalyst-funded proposals. I think it's essential that we have a group of experienced members who deal with this problem exactly, because in my opinion, it's no use funding projects that won't be executed in the way that was promised. So I think this proposal will have maximum impact if done properly. \n",

      "The description of the activities is good, but it would be more interesting if the proponents, instead of talking about a series of tasks that will be carried out from June to September 2022, explained exactly what would happen in each month within that time frame. I think the way it's been handed down to us, the script conveys a good idea of ​​what's to come, but it's not the most ideal possible. A very positive point in this proposal is how the authors explain in detail how the parts of the project would be, that is, meetings, research, reports, etc. This allows us to understand not only what would be done but also how it would be done. Therefore, we have a very clear vision of future activities, the only problem is that they are not so well situated in relation to time. Now going to analyze the budget, the explanation of the financing is done together with the activities, I think this is very interesting because we can understand very well the relationship between things and prices. Generally, bidders take the total amount and break it down into parts like development, marketing, etc., but they don't make the link between script and budget that clear. Therefore, in this bias, the explanations are perfect. I also think that the asking price is very fair for the work that will be performed and the benefits that this proposal is likely to generate. Finally, speaking of the team, the team is very strong, we know their names, professional roles and how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem (and they are active members, this is really one of the most experienced teams I've seen in the background). Full confidence in your ability to successfully execute the proposal is conveyed, so I have no criticisms to make on this part. Anyway, the feasibility here is very high, I will give it a maximum score because I think the information given was very enriching and makes us understand solidity all the instances of the project, but I still maintain my suggestion to better define the time of each activity. \n",

Proponents state that reports will be made including the following questions: “Meeting recordings and summaries + Analysis of audit processes of funded proposals + Research design, execution and results + Workshop recordings and summaries + Retrospectives and Final Reports + Community Research ”. In this way, we will have a wide range of information available on the progress of the phases, so that we can fully monitor the development process. In fact, there is no criticism to be made here, the proponents have already committed to giving very complete gradual feedback to the Cardano community, in addition to a final report, through which we can verify everything that has been done in this project. Regarding the final results, the proponents explain at length and in rich detail what the Audotira Circle will be aiming at, that is, the specific objectives of the group. With this, we have enough data to monitor if the project has reached its goals, making the auditability of the success scenario fully possible. It is enough for a member of the Cardano community to establish contact with the team in order to investigate these issues, or perhaps this is not even necessary, since they said that they will provide a final report where all this data should already be included. Therefore, both the auditability of the process and the results are perfectly contemplated, with the maximum score being more than deserved in this part of the proposal. \n",

      "The proposal is perfect for the challenge as it will surely help both the people of the African continent and the Cardano blockchain. It is about expanding the Mediators.ai platform, formerly known as Win Win, so that its activities are also developed by African countries. Let's first recap what the Mediators.ai platform is: founded by the company Loxe Inc., this platform aims to resolve conflicts between people outside the traditional judicial system. The idea is to exclude unnecessary and abusive fees, as well as the bureaucracy that is traditionally found in the judicial systems of each country. This project is already underway in the United States, because most of the entrepreneurs who founded the platform live there, so they already have more knowledge about how the system works there. This platform is already being expanded to Latin America, which is a very positive point here, because this proposal specifically intends to take Mediators.ai's activities to a new context, the African one, and it is not the first time that they expand the project. As a result, some assurance is already given that the proposers have experience in what they are doing, which automatically increases the chances of the proposal's impact being as positive as expected. I think it fits very well as it will benefit Africans a lot first. For example, they can work as mediators. This already represents an income opportunity, in a continent that we know is not easy to get a job and financial stability, at least it is not as simple as in places like the United States, for example. Another advantage for them would be to literally enjoy the service that is offered, Africans can start to resolve their conflicts in this alternative way, which is less expensive, more transparent (since everything that happens will be minted on the Cardano blockchain, making it inviolable and totally secure ) and faster than the resolution of conflicts in the traditional judicial system. For Cardano, this proposal would be interesting because it would certainly help to popularize our blockchain across the continent, it would break some of the prejudice that Cardano and blockchain technology itself still suffer, since Africans would realize in practice the advantages of all this. Perhaps this project causes greater adoption of our currency, creation of new digital wallets, greater transaction number on Cardano blockchain, etc.; that is, the ecosystem will certainly benefit greatly. Therefore, I think the proposal's impact will be maximum and it deserves to be funded. \n",

      "The proposal script is very good, it is determined which activities would take place in which months of the year. Despite not being the most detailed script of all, it is enough for us to understand in a safe way how the development process of this project would take place. I have no further remarks to make regarding this part of the proposal, as I think the information provided is already satisfactory. Regarding financing, I think the asking amount is fair for the scope of the project, and it is also quite simple to understand how it would be used. Basically, the total amount would be divided between the salaries of those involved and the “Location of the mediators.ai platform for South Africa”. I think that in this part a more detail would be necessary, because: we don't know exactly how many hours the mediator would work per month, for example, to receive his salary of 2 thousand dollars. What would be the part-time duration of the mediators.ai platform member, 4h? This is usually the case, the question is more about the mediator's dedication time. The platform location fee could also be better explained, I personally didn't quite understand who this fee would be paid to. I think the budget explanation is ok, but not ideal. And finally, speaking of the team, total trust is conveyed in the members of this team, for several reasons. Starting with the fact that they are already developing this project, that is, it is not something that is starting from scratch. They already have experience in the subject, which automatically conveys confidence in the group's ability to succeed in this new stage, as I also commented on impact. Also, they attach a lot of information about who they are, what their areas of academic training are, previous professional experiences and how they are involved with the Cardano ecosystem (and they are certainly very active, already delivering several products/services to our community, such as example the CA tool and vCA tool, so useful for us). So I think the only part of feasibility that deserved better attention and more detail is the budget, including the exact amount of hours each professional would dedicate to the project and also an explanation of the localization fee. This, however, does not diminish the quality level of this part of the proposal, which I think is quite high. \n",

      "Proponents have told us safe ways to monitor both the process and the end results. Regarding the process, they state that “internally, we will use the Agile methodology to manage and monitor our progress in the development of this project” (what would this methodology be? How will it help to organize teamwork?) and that, externally, a “progress report will be made through monthly meetings with the challenge team and coordinators' meetings with the IOG team”. That is, we have very clear ways of how the progress of the steps will be monitored. It would also be interesting if the proponents were to specify even more what the content of these reports would be. What will be done, if it will only contain the goals achieved that month or also explanations about the work routines of those involved in the project in that period of time. Speaking of the final scenario, I think the analysis suggested by the proponents is great for us to understand how the project reached in a quantitative way, because they specify what numbers (of mediators for example) are expected for each passage of time (3, 6, and 12 months). In addition, it would be very positive if the proponents also carried out research that tried to understand what were the impacts, qualitatively, of the project both for Africa and for the Cardano ecosystem. How did this proposal help our blockchain to become popular on the continent? Really, new people acquiring and delegating Ada, has general confidence in the technology increased as the project became known? It would be important for them to also clarify what the consequences of this initiative would be on our blockchain, specifically. Therefore, I think the auditability is good, but it could still improve in terms of deepening the analysis in the second part (of the final results). \n",

      "This proposal is very similar to another one: P.I.E for Community Development - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398308. The idea in the 2 proposals is to audit the proposals funded by Catalyst, starting from the assumption that the number of proposals being funded is growing very fast and it is difficult for IOG to track and monitor the progress and results of all of them. This is a real situation that really needs to be resolved, so much so that the present challenge aims to outline faster, more practical and safer strategies to promote the audit of proposals. However, the problem that I find here is that it is basically: what is the difference between the way to audit this challenge of the games in relation to the monitoring that they will do in the challenges classified as “community development”? I believe that each challenge has a unique nature, specific objectives that are very different from each other, their proposals act in different sectors (more focused on business, or technology or humanities, etc.) the way of auditing them also needs to be unique. However, this is not clarified here, in short it is not clear the difference between the auditability of the challenges present in the link I attached and in this one. Isn't it described how the P.I.E analysis framework would uniquely monitor game challenge proposals, how to differentiate and treat them in relation to others? Anyway, as much as it is a good idea, unfortunately I didn't understand very well why the same team and the same idea was launched twice and without clarifying why, exactly, the tool would be different for the challenge of games. In order for these issues to be resolved, the team would need to explain, in detail, how this proposal would differ from the other one and how the game challenge audit would be more specific than the others. Therefore, I will give it 4 stars, I believe that the idea here deserves this review in order to have its most assured impact. \n",

      "Again, the proposal says nothing special about the gaming challenge. We know important details about script, team and budget. In that regard, there really isn't much to complain about. In the script, they divide some objectives that need to be accomplished in a period of a few months, and it would be better to specify what would happen each month in the process as a whole, since in the first three months they don't do that and in the others they do, and details of each of the activities individually. It is possible to have a good perception of the process as it is described to us. Regarding the schedule planning, this part is not lacking, as it is quite rich in details. The money requested is also well explained, along with the description of the activities, we know how much would be spent each month and exactly with what, including the value of the hours worked in each activity. So, about the financing, I also think that this part is very adequate and satisfactory. Finally, as far as the team is concerned, it is one of the best parts of the proposal, because we know the name of each professional involved, their main function, social network links, including linkedin (this way we can have proof of what is said in the experience part) and finally a small resume of what each one has done so far. The team conveys a lot of confidence in its potential to successfully execute the proposal, the problem is, really, we don't understand what special would be done here regarding the games. If this doubt were resolved, I would certainly have given an excellent score for the feasibility of the proposal, but I cannot do that because the script itself does not explain what will happen differently here in relation to another proposal in them. \n",

      "The auditability of this proposal is good, but not perfect. As with their other proposal, the team informs us of metrics, KPIs and information that would serve as content to be monitored, both in the process part and in the final results. However, as I suggested before, some bridge needs to be established with the Cardano community. We cannot expect people to go after information without it being grouped and available in a practical and organized way. With that, I suggest that they make available the data that would serve to measure progress, such as “01 video uploaded for summarizing the Final P.I.E Report”, on some online platform that can be accessed by everyone. I suggest notion, because there you can put text, images, videos and etc. And so, some members more engaged by the project could be responsible for doing this follow-up. And regarding the final results, my suggestion is that the team come up with a presentation and meet with the rest of the community sometime in Town Hall, for example, or in some specific room to debate funded proposals after the general meeting. In this meeting, important points would be exposed about whether the scenario that was imagined became reality, if the more macro objectives of the whole thing were achieved, that is: if the proposals of the games challenge were being particularly targeted and audited. With this, auditability would be better performed, we would know if both the process (partial results) and the final scenario (final results) were successfully and clearly achieved. The grade is 4 because they already provide us with part of what would be needed to audit proposals, but not the entire analysis (the bridge with the Cardano community was missing). \n",

      "I really thought this proposal was fantastic in terms of impact, it is fully aligned with the objectives of the challenge and I'm sure it will generate good results for Cardano. Proponents begin by contextualizing readers about the context, which takes place in Ethiopia, and the problem situation to be faced. Ethiopia is the pioneer location in relation to the adoption of the Cardano blockchain, as a large-scale project to implement the Atala Prism DIDs was developed there. By several educational institutions in the country, decentralized identities are being coined and are used to record the data of their students. This process, as we are told, is called “The Cardano Deal”. Theoretically, this sounds perfect, but proponents claim that there are still several difficulties to be mitigated. For example, not all families in the country have access to technology. Companies still have some difficulty in trusting such a technological identification process; often preferring manual, outdated and corruptible resources, unfortunately. The idea here so that this situation can begin to be resolved is to implement a system of integration of Atala Prism DIDs with the students' curriculum. In this way, the information would be completely reliable, non-corruptible and could be verified by the companies. The platform would be called Fairway, and would have as its main objective connecting “atala PRISM educational records and credentials to our recruitment platform and running a pilot to achieve the first proven recruitments carried out using these VCs in the Ethiopian market”. With this, “Ethiopian students who have educational records on Atala PRISM will be able to have their VCs verified on the Fairway platform and directly prove their educational records to recruiters using our platform as part of the recruitment process”. Summarizing what has been proposed, the group intends to evolve a project that has already been launched in Ethiopia, allowing companies and students to benefit; as well as, of course, the Cardano ecosystem, since the DIDs will have one more use, causing more students to be motivated to be part of the project, more institutions too, and companies to recognize more functionality provided by technologies of the Cardano ecosystem, which can generate a good image and greater adoption of our blockchain in the country. Therefore, I think that the impact here will be maximum, and this part of the proposal certainly deserves maximum marks. \n",

      "In terms of roadmap, first the activities are separated into some groups (called milestones), in these milestones are described very specifically what would need to happen for the project to come to fruition. In relation to temporality, just below the proponents provide a timeline, so that we can then have an idea of ​​how these activities would be organized in relation to the passage of months. However, this temporal organization is not as precise as I would like. In my opinion, the ideal would be for these two parts to be merged, so that a more practical roadmap would be provided to us. If the milestones were determined according to the passage of months, and it was detailed what would happen in each of them, I believe that our visualization of the process would be more logical and simple. So I think this part of the proposal is good, but it's not perfect because its overall visualization is still a bit confusing. Talking now about the budget explanation, I think this part is just satisfactory, we know how the total amount would be divided into parts and each of these parts is detailed in an average way. For example, in “50% of a Fairway sales team member for 3 months: 50% of 3 x 3800$ = 5700$”. We know what the Fairway team member's salary would be, but we don't know exactly how many hours per month he would spend on this project, so we can't conclude whether the hourly rate of work is fair or abusive. Under “Hire 2 additional sales and marketing reps for pilot which is 3 months = Hiring costs 2000$”, the same thing happens. How much time would these professionals dedicate to the project so that the value can be better analyzed? In “Additional pilot testing and running costs for the Fairway team: $3,000”, why would this step be necessary and why would it cost that amount? Regarding the team, this is definitely the best part of the feasibility, as we know a lot of details about all the members involved. Their names, we also have their resumes, with their specialties explained, which projects they have developed so far, how they relate to Cardano, their linkedin profiles; in short, everything necessary for a good trust to be passed in relation to them. Therefore, I consider this part to be perfect, with no improvements being necessary. In general, the proposal is viable, but some improvements could be made, as I mentioned throughout the analysis of this topic. \n",

      "Finally, when it comes to the auditability of the project, the proponents start by stating what should be expected as results over time (second quarter of the year, third quarter, etc.). They also attach some KPIs that are very relevant for us to understand if the project would be achieving the expected results, such as “number of checks done for proof of education credentials and number of hires made for people who have proof of education credentials”. However, I don't think this part of the proposal is that complete, because 1) the proposers are only concerned with reporting the partial results, and not with the oversight of the process that would be behind it. How could we monitor their work routines? 2) it is not so clear how these KPIs could be constantly checked by the Cardano community. What will be the platform that will bridge the gap between the project and the community? Would updates be posted on any website? Any social network? I think if these improvements had been made, the project would ideally be monitored against the process. Now, focusing on the final results, the recruitment by the companies with whom they had their DIDs attached to VC's would be the most objective way to perceive the success of the action. And the real success would be, as I understand it, when this type of recruitment is happening on a large scale, so that the full potential of the Atala Prism DIDs is utilized. Despite the proponents claiming that this data will be available in the first quarter of 2023, we don't know where. I think it is very important that they define the platform for communication with the community, both for the delivery of partial and final results. Another thing, I think we could pay a little more attention to the consequences of all this for Cardano in Ethiopia. Has this project captivated young students to research and study more about our blockchain technologies? Could it be that companies, realizing some solutions provided by Cardano, are interested in investing in our currency and adopting other technologies as well? I think that this study should be done and disseminated as well as the direct results of the project. I think the auditability is good, yes, it can be improved only in a few points. \n",

      "I think this proposal is great and fits very well with the objectives of the challenge. In summary, the idea here is, in the words of the proponent: “develop a dApp that helps urban micro farms operate and expand”. We know that nowadays there are already several people growing organic food in their own homes, either through traditional and vertical gardens, or also for economic or ideological reasons (eat healthier with food from their own backyard). Despite being an activity that is still very niche to me, it is something that tends to become popular over time, as people spend more time at home (we know the effects of the pandemic on most workers: many people started to operate, at least in part of their journey, from a home office), and with that they develop hobbies. The wave of healthy and organic food also tends to grow, in my point of view, as people become aware of the harm that pesticides do to our body and how the slow food movement is gaining strength. Anyway, I said all this to justify the relevance of this Dapp, which when seeing invests in something really promising. As the proponent says, this application would be endowed with various activities, such as “providing cultivation instructions for specific crops”, “providing an API to collect data from environmental systems and IOT sensors” and many others. One of the most interesting functions in my point of view is to help people find these urban farms close to where they are, this is certainly something very important, because many times these things happen without their own disclosure and the food ends up not being used. as due. I think that helping people to connect, using our blockchain technologies, with the aim of maximizing the activity of micro-sized food cultivation is something that is very much related to sustainability, which is one of the pillars of Cardano. Regarding how this can all benefit the Cardano ecosystem, the author of the proposal explains the various ways our technologies would be used in his application, such as, for example, all food-related data would be minted on the Cardano blockchain, at some point in time. project payments (sale of food and etc) could be made with Ada, also the fact that the application would be developed, as far as I could understand, by students from a Design school (the funding money would go to help them); In this way, we would indirectly be meeting the goals of the new members onboard challenge, as these students would get to know Cardano and learn about our ecosystem while building a Dapp that would work based on our technologies. So, I really loved this idea and I think it will benefit the Cardano ecosystem in many ways, creating a relevant Dapp that will help popularize it and build on some of our technologies. \n",

      "The viability of the project is very high, but it could still improve in some ways. The script is quite clear, but we do not have much detail about the activities that will be developed. For example, the UX design will be done by the end of June 2022, as other steps are correlated with time. Regarding temporality, it is very clear what will be done and when, but not how. As it is a very complex project, permeating several tasks performed by different professionals, I believe that the visualization of the process is good, but it could be even better if the proponent detailed this schedule in more detail. For example, we know the design will be developed until June, but each month, what progress will be made? Ideally, I think this schedule should be done like this: divided into months and those into weeks, so we could understand very clearly what would be done, how and when. In general, I think this part of the proposal is good, but it could be even better. Turning now to the budget, I think the amount of money asked is adequate for the complexity and size of the project, and we also have two positive points here: the fact that the team has already obtained funding in other ways and they have already tried Catalyst in the background. 7, did not succeed but also did not give up, which shows persistence and effort as they perfected the idea/proposal. Now talking specifically about how the 15k orders will be used, the total amount is split between the pay for the design interns and the backend and plutus developers. I found the value of these salaries quite compatible with the market. My suggestion here would be that, as was done in the case of the intern, specifying the developers' working hours as well, in order to increase understanding. And finally, in terms of the team, I think they could be more detailed in this part. We know who the 3 permanent members of the team are, their names and their linkedin profiles, where we can find out in a proven way their previous work and in which professional area they are currently working. A short summary of their CVs and what roles they would play in this project were also attached to the proposal, as well as information about how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem. However, these explanations are quite succinct, they could be more developed. It would also be important, in my opinion, that we had knowledge about the design interns, and how they would be guided. \n",

      "The auditability of this project is quite secure. Starting with the fact that we have an intense detail of the process, what would have to be done and approximately when. With that, we know what to expect and we can monitor whether things are going as planned. This process auditability would be further improved if a weekly schedule, with probable dates, were created. That way we would have more material to be monitored over time. However, as it is, I think we already have good material to carry out this analysis, because in terms of impact, the proponent also details a lot of what would be found in the application, so we could establish periodic meetings with the project team in order to know if these small parts are actually being created, such as the guides on how to grow each specific food. We know what is expected as partial results, I think these meetings could be done monthly, that way the community would always be on top of project updates. This could happen between some community members and the team, and the result of the meetings could be summarized in a very summarized and accessible document for everyone, which could be forwarded to the rest of the Cardano community. However, in addition to my suggestion, the team already promises to show the partial results “live and a public sandbox”. What would that be, exactly? Regarding the result, we do not lack several pieces of information to be monitored. The team informs what the final goals of the application would be, like contributing to the problem of hunger, for example, and many metrics are also established, which can be easily verified, of what would have to be ready by a certain moment. In other words, I think it's a proposal that provides several ways to audit and that's why this part of the proposal deserves top marks. \n",

      "This proposal fully fits the objectives of the challenge, I believe it can be a gateway to an audience that is not necessarily blockchain enthusiast, but wants to learn languages, and if the game is successful it will automatically attract people, because of its premise , who organically became members of the Cardano community. It is a world creation, in fact several worlds, in which the player will interact with the environment to learn a language. Each language is a world, and each world and the little things within them will be DAOs, which is where Cardano's technologies come in. It is also said that Atala Prism DIDs will be integrated into the game, so that the advances made can form a kind of curriculum of proficiency in that language, which can be used for game purposes or for real life. It is interesting that the environment adapts to the player and not the other way around, as it is said, many times in the traditional learning process the student needs to \"force the bar\" to fit the context, and here the learning would be in its own time, at least. As I understand the challenges will become more difficult as the student/player improves their proficiency in the chosen language. Multiple languages ​​are listed, I think the game will appeal to a very wide audience (I would play this myself, and I'm not a traditional player). I think it was very positive how the proponents explained so extensively and in such detail a) the concept of the game b) the gameplay c) the target audience d) how this all relates to the Cardano ecosystem. So I'm sure this project deserves full marks, it seems to be a fun way to learn that will benefit the entire gaming community that wants to venture into new languages; it looks a lot like exploration and world building games, which are very successful; and it seems to me a project that will have a high positive impact for our blockchain, as it will adopt our technologies in many ways. \n",

I think the action schedule is good, but it could be even better, we could have a more specific view of this development process. About the budget, I also think the explanation is good, but somewhat superficial. We know that the money requested would mostly be used to pay the salaries of those involved, but we could know, for example, how many hours they would work per day, if they would dedicate themselves every day of the week to this project... the value of their working hours and our understanding of how the funding would be used would be much more in-depth. That is, both the script and the budget are explained in an ok way, but not ideal. Now talking about the team, this is the best part of the feasibility, we know a lot of details about the professionals involved, such as their names, what professional area they work in, a good resume with previous experiences and their linkedin profiles. We have complete confidence in them, as their descriptions are very rich in detail, I really think they are technically prepared to successfully execute the project. The attached video is super cute and already demonstrates a little bit of what they are capable of doing, as if it were a kind of project trailer. Finally, my view is that feasibility is good, but not perfect, as I've mentioned; the first two topics should be more deeply detailed and the last topic (from the team) is perfect. \n",

      "This topic is very good, but I still have suggestions to make. Several KPIs are pointed out, for short and long term, which can serve as measurable consequences to verify if partial results would be obtained. It is not so clear, however, with these data they will come to the knowledge of the Cardano community. Would there be monthly reports? And if so, through which communication channel will they be made available? We have several ways to do this, such as our telegram groups, discord channels, even online platforms like google docs (just that everyone who has the link can access the document). In general, I think we do have something to audit, I just don't know how, because they don't make this bridge with the Cardano community so clear. Now about the final results, some successful statements are not given, such as: “we intend to finish the base content of the game and iterate on the MVP”, “the finalization of the basic linguistic content for each language to define common bases and approaches for learning ” and “we hope to include some first PRISM components and start the formation of test-DAOs”. Again, we know what would be measurable, but we don't know how; I would very much like the proponents to make it very clear how they are going to get this data to all members of our ecosystem. I think that, in general, the auditability is good, but it could be improved, a survey could also be carried out with the players, trying to understand if they sought to learn more blockchain, if they were captivated through the game to get more involved with Cardano, in particular. I always think it would be a good idea for a general meeting to be held after the game's full release and a few months of activity, so that we could understand if everything went as planned in the game's development process and also study more carefully the consequences of this for Cardano. \n",

      "I really liked the idea and I think it fits very well with the specific objectives of the challenge. Here, we are proposing that media content (videos, photos, audio, etc.) be created on Cardano, and that this content circulate on different platforms that escape from places where Cardano already has a good circulation of content and a good audience, such as for example , youtube. The idea is that, with content circulating through new platforms, new audiences are reached, thus increasing the expansion capacity of the Cardano ecosystem. This proposal is about a platform called Goodwall, which is focused on young audiences and educational content, from what I understand. The advantage here is precisely that, in addition to posting videos, this platform has some different features from youtube itself. This can be seen through the excerpt: “A constant dialogue and feedback collection is carried out through a number of means, such as: dialogue with the Goodwall Student Council, a group formed entirely by young people that has an advisory and consultative role in the Goodwall's governance and strategy; ii) regular communication between Goodwall's Community Management Team and young users of the platform through chats, pages and posts; iii) focus groups held regularly and composed in order to provide a representative sample of the target audience; and iv) post-program surveys to assess performance and impact achieved”. I confess that, the first moment I read the proposal, I thought: what's the point of releasing videos about Cardano on a platform that is much less known than youtube? However, when I got to know these features, I was convinced that it can be an impactful initiative, as this bridge and communication between the users of the application is the differential in relation to youtube. I also think that the project fits well with the objectives of the challenge because the proponent explains that young people would be encouraged to create and submit content of their own creation on blockchain; this is very positive because I believe it can generate a boom in relation to the subject, due to the fact that this content would be encouraged through prizes, financial rewards or access to more educational content. I think it's a great way to captivate this target audience to learn and mobilize in relation to the cause, after all, everyone likes to receive these rewards, let alone if they are in cash. Another positive point that I see in this proposal is that the proponent is very aware of the possible problems that he will face during the project, and already proposes solutions for this, which demonstrates a lot of maturity and planning. The only negative point I found here is that the proponent does not say exactly what topics within the blockchain universe would be addressed, in what order and why, if this were said, it would generate a more solid understanding of what will be created here in the future. Other than that, I think the idea is very good, and deserves to be carefully evaluated for possible funding. \n",

      "Regarding the script, I think this part is well executed, but it could be even more detailed. For example, about program preparation, we know that this would involve the following activities: User Journey Design + Promotional Asset Design + Video Shooting and Editing Challenge + Education Series Video Shooting and Editing + Education Series Video Shooting and Editing Speaker Session Videos + Landing Page Design. We also know that all of them would result in a total time of 8 to 12 weeks to start, develop and finish. However, the information could be passed on more precisely here. For example, we could know how long each of these activities would take, exactly (or approximately) to develop. Let's see, user journey design, how long does the team intend to work on this? And what exactly would that user journey be? It would be positive if, in addition to a more precise time determination, the proponent attached a short explanation about these parts, because this way we would understand more accurately each step of the process and this would result in a better understanding of the whole. Now speaking of the budget, something similar happens. The total amount is divided into a few parts, but these parts are gates of many other small parts. Let's exemplify to make it clearer: “Creation of Program Material - Creation of promotional and non-promotional assets - social media, videos, landing page, content, profiles, newsletter, etc: $3785”. How much would go towards creating promotional and non-promotional assets? What would these assets be? What social media would be used to publicize the materials created? How much money would go to the newsletter? I think each of these parts could be better detailed, because we know the value that will encompass all these parts of the project, but we don't know what each one individually would take in relation to this larger piece. I believe that both the script and the budget are good, but they could be better if they were more specifically detailed. Finally, in relation to the team, I think this part is excellent. We know a lot of information about each member of the team: their names, professional roles, previous experiences and the responsibility they would have, exactly, in this project. I think this is all very essential so that we have a solid view of who we are dealing with, generally in the proposals the proponent only informs the name and previous experiences of those involved, and in this we also have the definition of the exact role that each one would play in this project, which gives us a very deep understanding of how this team works. \n",

      "The proponent suggests 3 ways we could track the development of the project: impressions, engagement, and challenge submissions. I think they are really good indicators to see how this project is developing in practice, but it is not clear how this information would be accessible to the Cardano community. In my opinion, it would be interesting if the team carried out a monthly survey on these variables and made the survey results available to the Cardano community, through any of our various communication channels, such as telegram or discord channels, in meeting rooms. debate after Town Hall and etc. It is up to the team to choose the most appropriate means of communication to convey this message. It would also be important, in my view, for us to know how their work routine was being developed, that is, did everyone manage to fulfill the tasks planned that month? Did everyone work the hours (hours) that were agreed? If there were problems and/or delays, how can these be overcome and compensated? In addition to understanding the achievement of partial results, it is also necessary to monitor the tasks that are being carried out so that such results are achieved. Now talking about the success scenario, in other words, the final results, I think this part of the proposal turned out great because the proposer gives us numerical data that would be used to measure success: “1 million impressions + 30,000 appointments + 2,000 entries challenge”, and also qualitative. It would be important for the proponent and his team to seek to understand how these young people who had access to the created content got involved with Cardano, if they followed their studies in the blockchain area; it would also be super interesting if some of the content generated by them were shown in Town Hall, because then we would see with our own eyes the fruits of this initiative. Finally, I would like the proponent to carry out a qualitative research on the results of the project, which would allow us to understand beyond numbers how this has all impacted young people and also the Cardano ecosystem, if we actually have new active members and how they relate to our ecosystem. This data could be presented at a Town Hall meeting, as well as a small snippet of content produced by young people, as I suggested above. I think the auditability is almost perfect, it just lacked a little detail. \n",

      "The proposal is very interesting because it intends to create a platform where people can make donations in favor of reforestation in India, and in return they would receive NFTs. It is very positive how the proponent explains which parts this part would be created from (the website, where people could see afforestation campaigns and choose the one they like the most to donate, the Minter NFT, where the NFTs would be minted and the marketplace , where people could see the NFTs associated with the campaigns). With this explanation, we were able to understand in a very solid way how the platform would work. I believe that the proposal aligns well with the objectives of the challenge as this project would certainly help India from an environmental perspective, through reforestation. The Cardano ecosystem would also benefit from the moment that new people, motivated by the environmental issue, come into contact with the platform and organically learn more about Cardano. This can generate a membership of new people in our community, which would automatically increase investment in Cardano, either through the purchase of Ada, we know that new NFTs will be registered on our blockchain, maybe this new audience will also get involved in Catalyst, whether as CA, vCA or proponents... Anyway, in many ways, the popularization of Cardano would positively impact our blockchain. I found it very positive how the proponent explains at length the idea and construction of this platform, as this generates full understanding of the idea. While it's very positive that the proponent draws inspiration from Veritree's Cardano Forest initiative, it's always good to have a role model as it generates a better sense of direction. \n",

      "The proposal's script is very good, it is described which activities should be done according to the periods of the year. Generally, the proposals separate what will happen in a longer time, such as quarters, but this one is different, as it points out what would happen each month. This generates a more accurate understanding of the development process to be followed. The budget is also very well explained, the tenderer divides the total amount into several parts, most of which correspond to the salaries of the professionals involved. We know what the value of the month of work would be, but it would be even more interesting if, for example, it determined their working day, that is, how many days a week and for how many hours a day they would work. The part of marketing and legal costs, in my opinion, could be better detailed. How much will go to marketing, and how much will go to legal? What will the marketing campaign look like? Finally, in relation to the team, a lot of information is given about each of those involved, their names, linkedin profiles and a series of topics that talk about their professional aptitudes and some previous experiences. It is very positive that we have people here involved with the Cardano ecosystem. This generates a feeling of tranquility and security regarding the subjects and technologies linked to our blockchain. In short, I found the feasibility of the proposal very high, the only thing I would change would be a little more detail in the budget part, other than that, everything is described in a very detailed way, giving full understanding of the project's gradual construction process and a lot of security in relation to the team being prepared to work on the project and make it a success. \n",

      "Regarding the progress of the process, the proponent states that “The solution describes how the platform will operate and how user groups will interact. The various components of the platform have been identified. The roadmap provides timelines for clear deliverables.” This is true, however, how will such information reach the members of the Cardano ecosystem? I would like him to have exemplified how he will transmit these indicatives to all of us in a simple and direct way, because community members cannot be expected to seek this information, there are many funded proposals, which generates the need for each team to have the auditability of the most practical way possible. It would be interesting for him to make monthly reports on progress, taking into account the various indicators mentioned, and for this report to be posted on one of the community channels such as discord, telegram, etc. Regarding the final success, many KPIs are indicated and what is expected to be achieved in the periods of 3, 4, 6 months and in 1 year. What is not lacking is content to be monitored. Again, in my opinion, the correct thing is that at the end of each period of time mentioned, the proponent makes an overview and indicates whether the expected success was achieved, and takes this information to the members of the Cardano ecosystem. The same platform chosen for the dissemination of partial results can be used, for example. Summarizing my opinion, the auditability is very good, leaving only to be desired the way in which all this information will be taken to the Cardano community. \n",

      "In terms of impact, I believe that this proposal addresses very well what the challenge is looking for. We need to help expand the Cardano ecosystem but also benefit Africa and its natives, the projects funded here need to have these two facets. In this case, this project can be perfectly summarized by the passage “prepare professional slides and practical guides that can be translated and used to carry out the Workshop in Africa lasting 4 to 8 days”. The proponent states that there is no material that is suitable for being translated into several languages ​​and presented both to a more lay audience (the first days of the workshop) and to the more technological ones (who, according to the author of the proposal, will study how to build in Cardano, use cases, about smart contracts, and more in depth). Therefore, I think that the idea aligns well with the objectives of the challenge, since if this workshop is translated, it could help to introduce what is blockchain and what is Cardano to a wide audience, in the same way that it can help those professionals from the technology area who think about working with the opportunities that our ecosystem offers but don't know exactly where to start. That is, without a doubt, this proposal would benefit our blockchain, helping it to become more popular and widespread. The question here would be, in this case, how much this workshop is aimed at the African public, how much the classes would be adapted to the specificities of this community. We know that the workshop would be created in English and later translated into other languages. However, when doing a quick search on which languages ​​are most spoken on the continent, I came to the following results: French, English and Arabic are apparently the most widespread dialects there. Therefore, I think that perhaps it would be necessary for the workshop to be translated at first into these other two languages, as there is already a lot of content about Cardano in English (in fact, the language barrier is what most hinders the broad democratization of our blockchain) . Therefore, I don't know if it would be interesting to launch this project purely in English, in my view the objective of benefiting Africa would be better contemplated if the proponent asked for a little more funding and already made the materials available in Arabic and French as well. A very positive point that I would like to highlight is how detailed the workshops are already presented, this demonstrates a lot of planning and mastery of what is to come. So my only suggestion is really to cover the language range better. \n",

      "The proposal script is perfect. We know exactly what would be done and when, as the bidder details what will be done each month and specifically the planned activities by week. In this way, we have a full understanding of the project development process. Therefore, in relation to the schedule of activities, I have no criticisms to make, in my opinion it is excellent. Moving on to the next point of analysis, regarding the budget, the price of the project is based on the amount charged per slide (25 euros each). I found a very high value, however, we do not know how many hours the professionals involved would dedicate to this project, so we have no way of knowing if it is a fair or exorbitant value. I think it's up to the voters to decide their opinion on this, because explanations we have, we understand how the approximately $6500 requested would be used, the proponent also clarifies in great detail how the funding will be spent in practice. Finally, regarding the team's presentation, in this case, from what I understand, only one person (Dmitry Shibaev) would develop this project. On the one hand, there is a lot of trust in him, as he explains extensively what his previous experiences are, we can see that he is a person who has already developed many tools and he attaches the link so that we can verify in practice each of the technologies previously developed by he. We also know how he relates to the Cardano ecosystem, so we have a lot of confidence in his ability to run this project successfully and smoothly. However, I am concerned that the team is formed by one person alone, because I think it is always necessary that, for example, a designer be present, especially in these projects aimed at producing material to be disseminated. As important as knowing about the quality of the content created is knowing how it would be presented. It would also be interesting for someone who understands marketing to be on the team, to help multiply the reach of the slides that will be created. Therefore, I think that, despite being a fully qualified person, it would be more appropriate if he worked together with other professionals as well. Therefore, the feasibility is very good, but there are still things to improve. \n",

      "Regarding the auditability of the process, I believe it is perfect. Generally, my suggestion is that monthly reports be made with some KPIs indicating how the project construction process is going, and that is exactly what the proponent suggests. So, once again, I have no points to criticize, as I absolutely agree with what is proposed. However, talking about the final results, the proponent outlines a very basic success scenario, which corresponds to the main objectives (that the slides are made and that the community gives positive feedback). However, I believe this is the basics. We need to go further in the way we monitor the results of this project. It would be essential to know: a) where these slides are circulating b) which languages ​​they were translated into c) approximately how many people would be having access to them d) how these people would be putting into practice the knowledge acquired in the workshops. Have these people become active members of the Cardano community? Are they getting Ada, buying NFTs, using our Dapps? What is happening in relation to the ecosystem, and how has it impacted their lives and the lives of those around them? It would be essential for the proponent to evaluate all this, build a final report and make it available to the Cardano community (this can be done through the same means of communication that he will use to send the partial results reports). Therefore, I believe that auditability was considered excellently when it comes to the process, however, regarding the success scenario, the proponent was very superficial in its analysis, requiring a real deepening.\n",

      "This proposal is very positive for our ecosystem because it will provide instruction, as well as practical work, for young students who want to learn Plutus and work on projects involving this programming language. I think this idea is right in many ways. First, let's make it clear that, in my view, the proposal fits well with what the challenge proposes, as it is not something that would fully fit into any other challenge. It's not about adding new members on board, as the activities here are very specific and only students in the computing and programming area are adept to apply for the internship. It is also not about creating new hubs, as it is a stage and not the formation of a group with unique characteristics. The scope of the proposal is not aimed at any specific geographic region, as the challenges of Africa, East Asia and India are. It's not about developing a Dapp either. That is, in reality it is something that is outside the course and at the same time extremely beneficial for Cardano, since once new students are instructed to work with Plutus, a highly needed qualified workforce will be formed for several projects right here in the Catalyst I myself have already noticed several teams that needed a Plutus programmer. It is difficult to learn this programming language, both because the teachings are mostly in English (I evaluated a proposal that sought to translate Plutus' teaching into Vietnamese, another very good idea); and because it is not so easily accessible, there are not so many courses available, both because it is a very recent technology. Therefore, if two interns are hired to work at Loxe Inc, they will have the best way to learn: in practice. This will be as beneficial for the two interns contemplated as for this company, and especially for Cardano, as these future professionals will have a lot to contribute to the growth of our blockchain. \n",

      "The feasibility of the project is great. We know who the stakeholders are, what the development process would look like and exactly how the requested money would be spent. Let's start with the description of the script. This in my view is the only part of the feasibility that could be improved, as we are told which activities would take place each month in a somewhat basic way. For example, in “August and September 2022 - Publicize the internship program + Selection process with potential candidates”. Would the disclosure last 1 month and the selection process the other month? How would this program be publicized? Through the Town Halls, social networks, official announcements by email? How will the selection process be? Will the candidates undergo video interviews, as well as practical tests, so that the level of programming knowledge they have at the moment is evaluated? I think it is possible for us to understand which phases the project would consist of, but not with as much specificity as I would like. However, the other parts are excellent. Starting with the budget explanation, we know how the requested money would be used. I believe it is a fair value, it will be 3 months of project and the professionals will dedicate part of their time to instruct the interns, they would gain equipment (computers) and would also be remunerated for their efforts. It is very simple to understand where the requested money would be going. The division of the parts is done in a clear, concise and brief way, but as they are very defined purposes, I do not feel that more details would be necessary for the complete understanding of this part of the proposal. Now speaking in relation to the team, according to the descriptions given, they are highly qualified professionals. We know their names and we have a very detailed description of their resumes, as they are people who are very involved in the Cardano ecosystem and who are implementing their own businesses. We know that you already have some experience with Plutus, as they studied this language and from what I understand, they work with it on a daily basis at Loxe Inc. Therefore, I really believe that they are capable of developing this project very successfully and safely. The way the team is presented is entirely satisfactory. Therefore, the only part of the feasibility that in my opinion deserves more attention is the script, otherwise everything is in order. \n",

      "Auditability of the proposal is very possible because the proposers clearly explain how the monitoring of both success and partial results would be done. Regarding the progress (partial results), this auditability can be done as the proponents claim that they will deliver monthly reports to the Cardano community, through meetings with the challenge team and IOG coordinators. In this way, a lot of confidence is transmitted in relation to how the project would gradually develop, I believe that in these reports the team would situate the coordinators both about how the work routine has been (in this case, the training of interns) and the advances obtained that month (if the two interns are learning well what is being taught to them, what results have they already managed to obtain so far, that is, how are they delivering the products created, etc.). Therefore, everything is right when it comes to the auditability of the process. Regarding the success scenarios (final results), I would say that it is quite clear what we are trying to achieve: that the two interns really learn plutus through the teachings and practices at the company Loxe Inc, that the number of candidates per vacancy has the ratio greater than 10 to 1 and that two people are actually selected for the project. It would be very interesting if, after the internship, these young people could give feedback to the Cardano community, in order to explain how they intend to pursue their careers, how this experience was a differential for them, how much they learned, how the company's internal activities improved with your help, etc. This is my suggestion to further improve the final audotability.

      "I believe the purpose of this proposal is summed up well in the following excerpt: (create a) “decentralized platform to provide emerging market opportunities for organizations while providing users with a more rewarding and engaging experience to support conservation efforts” . The proposal is about creating a platform with several pools, where people can invest in weekly bets, and part of the profits and fees from each pool will go to non-profit organizations that seek to work for the conservation of the environment. I thought this idea was very smart, because: people wouldn't be betting on these pools just for the environmental cause, of course, once they know about this facet of the process, they can feel even more captivated to participate; however the ultimate goal is to profit. And that is sure to attract a large audience. Therefore, this proposal aims to fund a platform that can be beneficial to the Cardano ecosystem in a number of ways; first of all, once people become users of this platform, they will know about our blockchain, its possibilities and advantages, so the objective of expanding Cardano will be directly contemplated. In the background, this project will certainly have a very positive environmental impact (if everything is correct), because, as I have already explained, the purpose of the thing would still be to make a profit (on the part of the users) and indirectly the environmental organizations will benefit; with such improvement, it is as if they were receiving investments and will be able to develop their activities with more tranquility, fight for the protection of wild life and species at risk of extinction and so on. In other words, the proposal is a great idea and perfectly meets the two main objectives of this challenge, which are to benefit at the same time the Cardano ecosystem, attracting new people to our community, increasing the purchase of Ada, delegation in pools, as more people know Cardano the purchase of CNFTs would certainly grow as well; new digital wallets would be created and likely new people would participate in Catalyst, such as CA, vCA or bidders. And the second objective of the proposal would also be contemplated, which is the benefit of the African continent, whether in the social, economic or environmental sphere (as in this case). Therefore, I think that the proposal deserves maximum marks in terms of impact. \n",

      "The proposal roadmap is ok, we know which activities would be developed and approximately how long it would take. The problem I encounter here is the lack of specificity. In other words, information is passed on in a very abstract way. The time periods are very long, a bimester is a lot, I would like the activities to be separated at least in monthly intervals. Now talking about the activities themselves, I think they are just mentioned, when the ideal would be that each one explained in detail. For example: “build release team (8-12 people)”. How would this team be chosen? Would it be the people mentioned in the team part right here in the proposal? I counted less than 12 people mentioned, so if you are going to choose other professionals to embark on this project, what would be the selection process? The proponent mentions that they will seek to work in partnership with Wada, a well-established group in the Cardano ecosystem for having launched numerous proposals in the African challenge with the passage of funds. Could the other members be from there? Anyway, I would like each activity to be detailed more precisely. Now let's talk about the financial division, a total amount of 25 thousand dollars is requested, which is a high amount, but compatible with the complexity of the project. The explanation of the need for such an investment is quite rich in detail, as the total amount is divided into some parts (for example, 2500 dollars for legal and administrative part, another 2500 for development resources and so on). Each part of these has a small explanation of what would be done, in this way, it is possible to understand more accurately why such an amount of money is needed for the development of such activities. Therefore, I believe that the script part is very well covered, and the way it is presented to us, we have no doubts about the need for such an amount of investment. Regarding the team, I think this part of the proposal is very good too, we know who the people involved are, their names, areas of expertise and some information about previous experiences. It is very positive that it is such a multidisciplinary team, that is, we have people from different areas of knowledge involved here, and in this way both the technical parts and the design, marketing and etc will be well assured. My only two suggestions regarding this part of the proposal are: the detailing of previous experiences could be more in-depth; ideally, everyone would attach their linkedin profiles, not just a few people.

This is generally what I advise you to do: a monthly survey of all variables, so that we can understand not only how the activities and work routines of the professionals involved are taking place, but also how partial results are being obtained. However, it is not very clear how this information will reach the members of the Cardano community. How will these reports be shared with everyone? Are they posted on google drive, or on telegram and community discord channels? Regarding the audit of the process, this was the only question that remained pending. Now talking about the final results, the success scenario is outlined with quite specificity, as we can see from the following excerpt: “having a large engaged online community, a fully functional protocol on our platform, several successful project launches in collaboration with our non-profit partners and be able to generate and provide significant funds each month to non-profit organizations. endangered species and climate conservation organizations around the world”. The proponent states that such information must be measured, but again, it is unclear how it will be shared with members of the Cardano community. He says that they would work in partnership with Wada, as I said, and also with the Cardano4Climate group. It would be interesting to establish a dialogue with these two teams in order to understand how they bring the results of their efforts to the community in a practical and direct way. There are several ways to do this, such as video calls in Town Hall, as I said, online sharing through google drive, telegram or discord, in short. I think that the proposal is very auditable, it just needs to be clarified with the community Cardano can actively participate in this auditability. \n",

Our main task here is to develop ways to better educate and bring knowledge to those who don't know Cardano, however, unlike the challenge of new members on board, this one focuses on more particular communities; therefore, it is necessary that we take into account the cultural characteristics and native language of the groups we seek to reach. Therefore, in my view, a proposal that aims to create content about the Cardano ecosystem specifically for the Chinese audience, and post it on youtube or on the bilibili website (which the proposer claims is popular there) is fully in line with the objectives. of the challenge. I really think that the language barrier is what harms new people the most to understand what Cardano is, what its specifics are, what differentiates our blockchain from others, etc.; therefore producing content in the local language will make it much easier for this group to learn about our blockchain and actively join our community. The problem I identified here was the following: we don't know exactly what subjects will be addressed in these videos, nor the thematic axis in which they will act. For example, within the theme “introduction to Cardano”, subjects such as “what is blockchain”, “what are cryptocurrencies”, “how to create a digital wallet”, among others, could be addressed. On a topic of “how to work for the Cardano ecosystem”, Catalyst, the functions of CA and vCA could be mentioned, the possibility of working directly on some proposal, be it programmer, designer, advertising and so on, could be clarified. That is, we do not know what will be done here in practice, we only have a general idea of ​​what will need to be achieved. We also don't know how often they intend to release the videos, how they will be able to captivate the target audience to continuously watch what is produced, not just watch the first video released and leave the channel... say details, should have been clearer, so we had more confidence in the impact; without clarity, security is not passed, that's what I mean. Finally, I think the idea itself is great, that it totally fits with what is asked of this challenge, but we have my doubts about how it works in practice, so I'll give it 4 stars. \n",

      "The roadmap is very good, the proponent does what I usually suggest, which is to divide the project into months and explain in detail the activities to be performed in each of these time intervals. I think that because the project has a total duration of 3 months (at least this is reported), it would be interesting if he also specified what would happen weekly. In this way, we would have a very complete view of the entire process, because in addition to understanding in detail what would be done and how, we would know precisely when such a thing should be completed. That's actually my only observation about the script, I think it's above average for what I usually rate. Now, let's look at the budget. The bidder divides the total amount into parts, which are video production, video editing, platform engagement, etc. It would be a lie to say that it is not possible to solidly visualize how the requested money would be spent, as each of these parts is very detailed, for example in the production of videos, we know the total amount of videos, the price charged per hour and so on. However, I think that some parts of the budget still deserved further explanation, such as “engagement in social networks” and “diverse”. How would this engagement be done? On which social networks would something about this project be posted? And what would be posted? Short videos (in tik tok format), photos, texts? And about the various ones, what could they be? I would like to understand what would happen to that money if nothing went off plan, that is, if no last minute expense was needed. I don't understand why they charge about 400 dollars to post the videos, as this is theoretically a very quick thing to do. Finally, speaking of the team involved in the project, unfortunately this is the part that leaves the most to be desired in the proposal. As I understand it, only the proponent is a permanent member here, and it is not clear if he is looking for other people to form a group or if the intention is really to work alone. I think it's always good to work as a team, especially in a project that intends to generate more than 20 videos, there are many things to do. The proponent explains what skills are needed to work on this proposal, which leads us to understand that yes, he is looking for partners, but this is not entirely clear. Regarding the proponent, we are told his name and a very brief description of the ways he relates to the Cardano ecosystem; your twitter is also available. I think it would be more suitable if we had his linkedin and if he said what professional experiences he has beyond our blockchain. So I'll give it 3 stars as the feasibility has strengths but also a lot to improve. \n",

      "I don't think the project's auditability is very adequate because all the data reported are numerical, and in my opinion the best thing to do is to analyze not only quantitatively but also qualitatively the proposals. Regarding the development process, the proponent suggests that we look at the “subscriber numbers on Youtube and bilibili.com / members of the Chinese group Telegram / members of the Chinese group Discord”. However, when we are working on a project, we have two facets: goals and tasks to be accomplished so that these goals are achieved. How could we audit the activities that would be developed so that the number of subscribers on youtube and bilibili would increase, as well as the participants of the tegram and discord groups? It would be necessary for us to follow the script, so that we are aware if what was promised is being carried out in the correct way and in the planned time. For this, either the proponent prepares monthly itineraries and forwards them to the Cardano community, so that we are always updated on what happened in that period of time; or a member of the community closely follows the progress of things and then gives feedback to the rest of us. Likewise, regarding the final scenario, the bigger goals, we would also need the proponent to keep us updated at the end of the project. Has everything that was planned been completely achieved? And beyond numbers, is the Chinese community now more participatory in the Cardano ecosystem? Did they become bidders, CAs, vCas? Could it be that young people who study the area of ​​computing were interested in studying our programming language, learning to develop smart contracts? Anyway, I think it would be very interesting, in the case of this proposal, to carry out a survey directly with the target audience, so that we could understand how the impact was on their lives; and not just how many lives were impacted, do you notice the difference in approaches? This research could be done and the results made available to the Cardano community, either through a brief presentation in Town Hall, or a document prepared that practically informs what was researched, posted on the community channels (discord, telegram, email and etc). Therefore, in my opinion, the auditability of the proposal still has a lot to improve. \n",

      "A good excerpt that summarizes this proposal is “Mediators.ai (formerly known as Win-Win) is a decentralized dispute resolution platform and marketplace built on the Cardano blockchain. It allows disputing parties to find a suitable mediator to help resolve their dispute in a timely and cost-effective manner outside the court system.” This idea is launched by the team at Loxe Inc., a company based in the United States and previously a Catalyst winner (I was able to verify all this information through the link attached in the proposal description, which takes us to the company's website. it is possible to obtain other information about it, such as: the team that composes it, other projects that are being developed, the whitepaper and etc). I thought that is an excellent idea and that it perfectly meets the objectives of the challenge, as it will involve our blockchain technologies (smart contracts) in an unfortunately very common situation today: conflict resolution. The difference, however, is that all unnecessary bureaucracy would be dispensed with, and as the proponents explain, often expensive and expendable fees would in fact be excluded from the process. It is very expensive to file a lawsuit, regardless of the country. If there's a faster and cheaper way to do this, it's certainly an interesting option. In addition to the practicality and reduced costs, the alternative way that is proposed here also takes advantage of all the security that surrounds cryptographic transactions. All data that are recorded, that are part of the resolutions, will be duly minted in the Cardano blockchain, so that they are transparent, non-corruptible and non-tampering. All of this, obviously, would make a lot of use of the technologies relevant to our ecosystem. With this, the objective of popularizing Cardano to the greatest number of people will certainly be contemplated. I believe that there is still a lot of misinformation and prejudice about blockchain, and practical applications like this are certainly one of the best ways to make people understand what blockchain actually is and what its use cases are and how it can be advantageous. Thus, the number of Adas purchased and delegated will certainly increase, as will the amount of transactions, smart contracts and active tokens minted on the Cardano blockchain. In this case, this proposal is the evolution of the project already launched, so this further increases the chances of the impact being very positive. \n",

      "The proponents explain which tasks would be done in which months of the year, and the process of developing this proposal involves contacting the companies that will audit the smart contracts of this platform, and then the audit would be carried out by the outsourced company. chosen. In my view, despite being a succinct explanation, it is done in a very enlightening way, so that we have a good view of the steps based on the information provided. As a continuation of a previously funded proposal, the proponents are already well on their way to the work they will do, and this is a new phase to be tackled. Speaking of the budget, the requested value is 80 thousand dollars, it is a high value compared to the other proposals (in fact, we have proposals asking for much more, but I still consider it a great investment), however, it is justified because the project is of a extremely technical; the activities to be developed here would be carried out by an outsourced company, and the proponents claim to have already carried out a survey to find out how much money would be needed for this work to be done. According to them, it is not possible to give an exact value, so the amount requested is an estimate of how much would be needed for the project to be carried out. It is positive that the proponents claim that even if the real value of these audits is greater, they will pay for it themselves, completing the remaining parts; and also that, in the (difficult) case of being needed less than that, what would be left over would be reinvested in other parts of the platform development. Therefore, I consider that the budget explanation, even though it is outside the curve, is quite satisfactory. Finally, speaking about the team, we know the names of the proponents, their professional roles and a series of activities they have performed so far in their careers. They are active members of the community and have already proven in practice their capabilities and responsibility in developing projects and tools inside and outside the Cardano ecosystem. In addition to the fact that, as I said, this proposal is an evolution of something that already exists, which in itself already conveys a lot of confidence in the team's ability, as this idea is already a reality. \n",

      "The progress auditability is perfect. We know exactly how this project can be monitored. According to the proponents, the third-party company that will audit the smart contracts will provide reports, probably monthly, on the work that has been carried out. The proponents state that they will make these reports available to both IOG coordinators and all members of the Cardano community. That is, we will have a practical way to monitor whether the service that was promised was also fulfilled. I don't think I have any suggestions to make, as this part of the proposal is already exactly as I suggest it is. Now talking about the success scenario, this would be when third-party companies audit smart contracts. The proponents claim that these companies had a technical problem that ended up hindering the performance of the work, but that this will be resolved, audits will be carried out and that the results will be disclosed to the Cardano community later this year. I think it's a proposal where success can be perceived quite objectively, since the proposal is totally focused on a single action (auditing the smart contracts of the platform in question). So, if this is done properly, success will soon be achieved. Therefore, I consider it a very auditable proposal, it is enough for the proponents to actually forward the content that they claim they will make available to the community and to IOG, and I believe they will do so. \n",

      "The proposal starts from a true proposition: it is becoming increasingly difficult to properly audit all funded proposals. With the passage of funds, this number grows, and there are several teams, carrying out different activities, having different deadlines and objectives to meet, and if each one of them does not have its own well-defined auditability plan and, above all, that it is fulfilled with commitment and honesty. , there is no way for the Cardano community and IOHK to successfully monitor everything at the same time. Therefore, the proponents suggest auditing 50% of the proposals (in this case the main ones - I wonder, how would that be defined?) of the Miscellaneous challenge, through a created standard, which they call P.I.E (Proposal Implementation Evaluation). This standard would evaluate the proposals through pre-defined criteria, as they explain, which would be, for example, “the degree of fulfillment of the goals, commitments, KPIs/metrics established in the proposal”. In theory, this idea is great and it aligns very well with what we are looking for in this challenge, which is precisely to establish safe, faster and more practical ways to audit Catalyst-funded proposals. The problem here is that there are already other proposals from these same proponents suggesting the same thing, each one aimed at different challenges: one of them is aimed at a group they classify as “Community Development” and the other focuses specifically on the challenge of games. I think the team had a great idea to come up with a structure that will be used to analyze the proposals more directly and objectively, but it is necessary for them to explain the different approaches that would be taken between auditability in this case and in the other two cases of the proposals that they also launched here. Taking into account the specifics of each challenge, some focused more on technology (as is the case with this one), others more on the humanities (such as the challenges of Africa, East Asia and India, which focus on expanding Cardnao across these regions and helping the people there), what are the differences, even if subtle, in the way of monitoring these various challenges? Because of this key question, this doubt that permeates the reader when he realizes that there are two other proposals similar to this one (the links are: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398309 and https://cardano.ideascale .com/c/idea/398308), it would be necessary for proponents to explain the need for 3 different proposals to execute their ideas instead of one that encompasses all challenges. \n",

      "The proposal roadmap is very detailed, some time intervals are defined and with them we know the activities that will be developed in each period. My suggestion is that this division be done monthly in all cases (in the first three months this is not done) so that we have a more specific view of the process, so that we can understand exactly how long each thing would take. For example, the first 3 months would be for building the detailed picture of this analysis structure, P.I.E. But why would that take 3 months? What would the work routine of each professional be like during the first month, and the second, and the third? As for the rest of the time, it's explained better, we know what would happen each time, we have punctuated task topics that richly explain what would need to be done. Regarding the budget, this part is described together with the explanation of the roadmap, so that we can clearly understand how the requested money would be used. Generally, in the proposals, we do not see these two things being explained so closely, I liked this idea and I think it causes a more joint understanding than dividing the parts into blocks that do not dialogue, after all, everything is part of the same process. And finally, speaking of the team, this part of the proposal is great, it is a duo that provides a lot of information about who they are: their names, various social media (I usually suggest that at least the linkedin of those involved be attached, but the more information the better, as we can delve deeper into who these people are in different facets), it is also explained in topics about their previous professional experiences. With this, we have a very complete picture of who we are dealing with, and a lot of confidence is transmitted. The only observation I would like to make is that it would be interesting if they clarify the role of one of them in the project, specifically, what tasks would they perform here? And another thing, they say they have strong partnerships and they name the groups, but it would be interesting if they clarify what helping role these partners would play. Finally, the feasibility of the project is very good. \n",

      "The ways of monitoring the project that are suggested by the proponents are certainly good, but they can be deepened. Let's separate it into two parts: process and final results. Regarding the process, they are already willing to do what I usually suggest, a report that summarizes the activities that have been done so far, and even more would have a video that summarizes this report, making the information described easier to access. . However, they suggest that this document be prepared quarterly, when I believe that this time interval is too long, many things would be added to be reported, both small achievements, as well as the progress of the work routine, possible problems faced on the way and etc. The report would likely be long and tiring to read, so people would jump to the video. I think it would be more appropriate if this report were made available monthly, for example. This would make its size smaller and it would even be easier for the bidder pair themselves to organize it. One thing that was a little in doubt was how this information would be forwarded to the Cardano community. Would the report be emailed, posted on some Discord channel? Would the video be available on youtube and would its link be available in the report itself? It is necessary to think about how this bridge will be established. Now speaking of final results, the main objective here would be to audit 50% of the funded proposals for the challenge in question, but how would the quantity be verified? In the final report, it would be necessary for the bidders to include the link of the bids they audited, and for them to be organized in a numerical list, right? It would also be important, in addition to knowing how many people had access to the final report and its video, to understand how the adopted P.I.E structure benefited the auditability of the proposals. How can we see this difference in practice? Could the teams of some of the funded proposals be part of this video, reporting what has changed? How are they being evaluated, and how has this impacted your work? Anyway, I believe that yes, good forms of auditability are suggested, but that this should be done even more specificity and variability of approaches. \n",

      "The proposal meets the challenge's objectives well, because it suggests that a DAO, called SkatingDAO, undergoes a complete audit, in which its activities would be 100% monitored, both in terms of technical aspects and in the back and front end schedules, as well as in relation to organization of the participants and whether they are performing well (I suppose). After this audit was done, all the information would be gathered into a formal and very detailed document, which could serve as a model for other DAOs to be audited. Therefore, the idea is to facilitate the work of other professionals who want to create DAOs on the Cardano blockchain, so that they know what exactly would be done and how it could be monitored, so that they would have much more guidance when building from scratch. their DAOs, which would also reflect on costs, taking unnecessary expenses out of the way. In this way, the objectives of the challenge would certainly be achieved, because what we are looking for here are ways to help the Cardano community to exercise auditability. Generally, this is thinking directly in relation to the Catalyst proposals, but I think this case is also a very general and necessary application for our ecosystem, as I believe that there is not even any complete and standardized way to audit our DAOs. Therefore, this would be directly contributing for the community to be able to more securely audit one of its parts, and it is fully in line with what is sought in this challenge. It's good that we know how this StarkingDAO audit would be disseminated to the other groups. I think this proposal is divided into two main parts: auditing this DAO and sharing these results with the other DAOs at Cardano. How this process would be done in the following excerpt: “A video series documenting the process and our struggles and lessons learned + Documentation detailing the process we went through, costs and roadblocks + Supporting cheatsheets and checklists to help new projects plan and prepare for a full audit based on everything we learn on our journey”.

      "The feasibility of the project is just ok. All the information we needed to know is passed on very superficially. Starting with the script, the activities that would take place within the time span of 3, 6 and 8 months are stated. This does not give us a solid understanding of the development of the project, both because these activities are described in an extremely summarized way, and with that it is a very superficial report, how long the temporal spacings are very large. The time set for them to develop is quite long, it would be much better if the proponent had explained what would happen on a smaller scale, for example, monthly. The ideal would be for this temporal organization to be restructured and with that we would have a much better view of deadlines, and also for each of these activities to be more detailed. Regarding the budget, I think that a very high amount is requested, 32k, and it is not justified so well because it would be necessary. I would like to understand why this audit would cost 15k, who would work on it, how long it would take to work, in order to know how much effort would be put into it and understand beyond the complexity of the tasks its extent. That way, we would also have a better idea of ​​whether the asking price is fair or not. It is said that 12k would be needed for the audit to be written, edited and released, it is a very high amount (almost what is asked for in the actual construction of this audit), it would be necessary to explain the need for so much funding for this part. For example, what costs would be assigned for release? And why would only the act of making the audit accessible be paid, since the objective here is to share it with other Cardano DAOs? And finally, as far as the team is concerned, this part is also superficial, we don't know the full names of those involved (\"Edi\" for example, how can I search for him online without his full name?). Nor is a detailed curriculum attached for each one, they are only told in direct ways what they do professionally, but examples of previous work are not available, what paths they took to get where they are, how they met Cardano or what roles each of them would play for the execution of this project. That is, its functions here. It would be necessary for all of this to be said, in addition to a direct way of proving the information given, such as a linkedin profile for everyone, for example (Edi did not make it available). Therefore, I think that everything that is informed here should be better detailed and explained, so that the feasibility becomes better. \n",

      "I also found this part of the middling proposal. As usual, I think we need to audit both the development process and the final results, so let's go one step further. Regarding the development process, it is necessary that we follow the progress of phases here. That is, that we know if the small tasks that together will make up the whole are being done on time, by the right people and in the way they were promised. For this to be possible, I think it is necessary that a very detailed roadmap is present in the proposal, and therefore we have a basis for knowing what to look at to verify if things are right or not. And this is done here. The ways of auditing progress suggested by the proponent are “Our Github for the StakingDAO will feature a project Kanban board showing the current, next and completed steps in our process / We aim to have weekly updates to the documentation based on how the Audit is going , challenges faced and reports from the audit”. I think in terms of the process, we have good ways of monitoring the project, and if this contact is established properly, I don't think I have anything to complain about monitoring the development phases. However, regarding the final results, I found the suggestion given by the proponent to be very superficial; Namely, that progress will be confirmed when this StakingDAO audit is completed and all documents are made available and detailed. Okay, this really is a very direct and objective way for us to verify that the basics promised here were fulfilled, but it doesn't correspond to what we would need to know to properly audit the proposal, so I will give my suggestions. Other than that, we need to know if the audit that was made available to other DAOs is being used properly; if the other groups are basing themselves on it to build their DAOs, if it is really useful in the daily lives of these people. For this, it would be necessary to establish direct contact with the DAOs, establish a kind of questionnaire to understand how this audit is being used by them. With that, I think it is quite possible to audit the proposal properly and completely, but unfortunately, in the way suggested by the proposer, this monitoring would have a very superficial nature and would not be enough to convey confidence in relation to the final results. \n",

      "This proposal, despite having been briefly explained, seems to me to be very promising, well meeting what we are looking for in this challenge. The idea is to create a smart contract, using our Plutus language, which will serve as a caution, many also have the relationship and specifics of how this contract would be used). The objective that is both parties imply in the contract on the basis of “exchange value, in a way without trust and schemes”. In other words, the proponent intends to create an alternative for people who are still not so sure about carrying out transactions on the Cardano blockchain, due to the fact that it is a totally new process for most, of which it is not fully understood how it works, unlike anything that has already been done outside the cryptographic world. In fact, each blockchain works its own, so it's fair to say that an expanding Cardano ecosystem is still so involved with a bit of prejudice and estimation of its own on the part of the parties; or even the parties may not trust each other, wanting to run a test before actually doing what they want. As I said, it's interesting how the author created a hypothetical situation (with Alice and Bob), where we can see how the technology he intends to understand would work. In the part “a predefined “funds release window”, in case one of the parties does not withdraw its funds that would incur in proposals for the commitment assumed by the other party to deliver in the agreed time and values, etc etc”, the proposer explicit the use cases that this technology can provide. Overall, this project would help people build software on Cardano more securely, which would contribute to the adoption of our blockchain. That is, the objectives of the challenge will be proposed directly contemplated, probably the number of transactions will increase as more people would trust to do this; New members to our environment, increasing the number of Ada and CNFTs in circulation, also investment in other Dapps, new active members to our community can also increase. In short, I think the idea is very pertinent and could generate great results for our ecosystem, in line with what we are looking for in the challenge. \n",

      "It amazes me that the project development period lasts only two months. The script is superficial, in my view, we are told what would happen in the first and second month of the process, but this information is given in a shallow way. For example, in the first month the goal is to “create a detailed plan for the structure of this project. take into account the vulnerabilities of a smart contract by looking at those already living on the mainnet.” I believe that the structure of the project should have already been thought out and thoroughly explained here in the proposal, so that we had a better understanding of how this idea would be constituted in practice. What vulnerabilities would they be? How would it be examined? Which smart contracts would serve as a basis for examples? I think the script should be better detailed, the temporal notion is adequate, but the level of detail of the activities is still little. Talking now about the budget, only 3 thousand dollars are requested (a very low amount compared to most proposals); all that money would go to the developer of the smart contract. I think it's a pretty fair amount for 2 months of work, but it would be positive if the bidder explained if the developer would work full time or just part time. It would also be interesting if your work routine were better explained. And what about marketing? Will there not be any kind of dissemination of this technology? I think it should have been spread throughout the Cardano ecosystem, so that we knew how people would use it. That is, in my opinion, it would be important for the bidder to have asked for an amount so that someone in advertising could launch a strong publicity campaign; as important as creating a good service or product is making it accessible (known) by the target audience. Finally, speaking of the team involved in the project, little information is provided about the pair of professionals. We only know their professional roles and that they are part of the Gimbalabs group, that is, they are people well connected with our community. But still, I would like more details, to know what their previous experiences were, examples of projects they have already developed and also their linkedin profiles, so that we could see more practically about their professional lives.

They say that they will be guided by the activities and milestones of the roadmap and that they will run a test on the testnet network, before officially releasing the product. We don't know important things, such as, for example, whether the work routine of the developer who will work on the project will be monitored, how it will be monitored, what he has to deliver per week, how many hours he needs to work, how all this information can be measured and made known to all members of the Cardano community. In terms of partial success, how would it be measured and reported to all of us? Does the bidder intend to share the github repository or build a roadmap at the end of each project month? Talking about both tasks and goals? Unfortunately, I think it was too shallow how this part of the project would be monitored. Finally, when it comes to the end results, success is very well defined by obtaining “a well-documented example of a Smart Escrow Agreement that others can use in their own projects”. But I think that, like the auditability of the process, this part was very shallow. How can we define metrics that demonstrate the success of this project in a verifiable and reliable way? How to perceive the impacts of the idea for the Cardano ecosystem? Has this new technology actually contributed to more transactions being minted on our blockchain, more people choosing to work with Cardano over other blockchains? Has the number of active members somehow grown from this project? And has the satisfaction of the parties increased, the level of trust increased on both sides? I believe that it would be necessary for the proponent to collect this data, both quantitative and qualitative, so that we could better understand the consequences of this project for Cardano.

      "I found this idea to be really useful and it can be very positive for the Cardano ecosystem. It's about creating an issuer in the ecosystem of decentralized identities, with the goal of generally having a verified credential that can be part of the customer's knowledge process (as proponents abbreviate it, KYC). The justification for the problem is that customers currently have to provide their data many times, and the creation of this technology would generate a recyclable KYC credential, that is, one that can be shown to several companies; another advantage in developing this platform would be that this credential can be proof that they have gone through a verification process. In other words, the proponents gather a series of current problems (having to prove our identity several times, and also the lack of security for both companies and customers about the said information) and claim that all this will be solved with the creation of this credential. To my understanding, it would be a kind of extension of the Atala Prism DIDs. I found something that can revolutionize the way customers and companies relate, generating more practicality and security throughout the process, however, two things could be better clarified, in my opinion. First, I would like to know more specific features of these credentials. We know that in it, various information about customers would be minted. But which ones? What kind of personal and financial data would be made available? How would customers allow what data to be provided? What would the process of “creating” these credentials for the client look like? It is not very clear how this relationship would take place, once the technology was ready for use, how customers would configure it, that is, how the verification process would be carried out that would result in the recyclable credential, which would be presented several times for different companies and services. Another question I had was whether this project will integrate with the Atala Prism DIDs, we know that the two technologies will be linked, but in my view the proponents could have explained this issue better, in a language accessible to everyone. I think so, the proposal aligns well with the objectives of the challenge, because in it we are looking for ways to democratize, promote, make it more accessible, in short, increase the use cases of decentralized identities coined on our blockchain, and I'm sure that the usage suggested here would be very useful and positive for both customers, businesses and the Cardano ecosystem. If the doubts that I commented were better clarified, I would give the maximum grade to this topic of the proposal, but still, it is satisfactory. \n",

      "We know the total duration of the activities to be performed (14 weeks), which are divided into two groups: business tasks and technical tasks. The proponents explain what actions would have to be taken in each of these groups, for example in the business tasks there would have to be a search for candidates for service providers, a contract and service would have to be negotiated and so on. The estimated duration for these tasks is four weeks. I think that the way the script was presented to us is very logical and simple to understand, my only suggestion is that within these groups the estimated time for each of these tasks was defined. This is not strictly necessary, but it would help to deepen our understanding of the whole. How long would it take bidders to search for service provider candidates? How would this research be carried out, would it be online, probably, how would the authors of the proposal present their idea so that partnerships could be established, contracts would be defined? I think the script is good, being able to be a little more detailed regarding what would be done and also how long each thing would last. Speaking of the budget, the total amount of 26 thousand dollars (approximately) is well explained, we know which parts it would be divided into and most of these parts are very detailed. For example, in “60 hours of commercial work at a rate of $100/h: $6,000”, we know the amount charged per hour of work (I found this to be high, but it is up to the proposal readers to decide what to do). think), this budget topic is quite understandable. But already in the “Purchase of initial licenses for tests and demonstrations: US$ 2,500 (minimum estimated commitment)”, the proponents could have explained better what initial licenses are these, how much they are, why they are needed, what they would do in this project and etc. That is, some parts are more understandable than others, I would like the same level of detail to be presented for all. About the team, this part is average, because we don't have much information about Deryck Lance and Patrick Rivenbank; we only know their names and linkedin profiles, it would be necessary for the bidders to attach a small resume of them, in order to understand more about their careers and previous experiences, and also if they have any kind of relationship with the Cardano ecosystem. As for Rodolfo Miranda, we know a lot of information, his linkedin, what he does professionally and how he is situated within our community (he is an extremely active person, by the way). It would be perfect if the same explanations were provided for the other two team members. Finally, I think that the feasibility is very high, just needing a few points of deepening, but even so, it deserves the maximum grade. \n",

      "Apparently, the proponents are very well prepared and have planned to audit the process in various ways. They claim that they will use the Agile methodology (based on the tools provided by github) to monitor the progress of activities. I think it would be important that they had defined and exemplified how this methodology works, I personally don't know it, and I believe that other CAs and readers of the proposal will not know it either, so we couldn't have a complete understanding of what this way would be like to follow the succession of steps. They also say that progress would be tracked by github issues (how would that be visible to the Cardano community?), that they would make reports (how often, will these also be made available to community members?). They also claim that they will view the Kanban board; once again, it would be positive if they had explained better what this framework is like, what tool it is, how it works and what its objectives are for every project. It would also be interesting if they explained a little better about sprint burndown, used as a way to measure progress through sprint percentages (what exactly are sprints?). That is, I trust that they have objective and efficient ways to audit the development process, but they are explained in a very technical language, in which people who do not know the technologies and tools used will not be able to fully understand what will be done. Turning now to the final results, this part is explained in a very abstract way, the proponents claim that “the success of the project is the launch of the Proof of Concept system that will allow us to show demonstrations and KYC verification tests with credential issuance”. However, we already know this goal since the impact, it would be necessary for them to explain measurable ways of realizing if this was achieved and how it was achieved. Are these credentials really being used by customers as expected? Has this changed the process of purchasing services and products, making it safer and simpler for both end consumers and companies? How can we see in a proven way what the consequences of this project were for Cardano? The Atala Prism DIDs were popularized, did more people get to know and use this technology, thus meeting the specific objectives of the challenge? To summarize my opinion about the auditability of this project, I would say that the first part is great (audit of the partial results), but the second is still very abstract, as there are no direct ways of perceiving the success scenario. \n",

      "The problem debated by the proponent is that, in the current world, it is very difficult for artists to claim the copyright of their productions, due to the fact that they are easily manipulated, altered, copied and shared over the internet. This problem is clearly exposed by the excerpt “with trends built around remixes, mashups, intermusical and in-between works, authors and publishers continue to debate who owns the product”. Therefore, the solution proposed here is that a verification process, using blockchain technology, can issue certificates that are immutable at the end of the processes, allowing all parties involved to identify what was done (in a non-corruptible way); this would generate a greater understanding and consequent appeasement between the parties, as it would clarify the questions of originality of the works and who holds a certain part of the rights. I found a very important use for technologies relevant to Cardano, as it dialogues with a current and really relevant problem in the musical environment (there are not few examples of artists who sue each other for this type of situation). If all the information relevant to the process of creation, production, distribution, etc. of the songs could be proven through minting on the Cardano blockchain, this situation would in fact be more easily resolved. The proponent argues that there are already services similar to the one he proposes, but explains the differences between his services and others. I am also very positive about the part he dedicates to the proposal to explain how this project would be noticed, understood and adopted by people. I think it is useless to build useful and relevant technologies, but not explain and disseminate them among the target audience; it is necessary that the actions developed are taught in an accessible way to those in the field, even if they are not familiar with blockchain technology. And here, this bridge is well explained, as they will create a website where people could begin to understand and use the technologies developed, and they will also form partnerships as the project consolidates (thus increasing its popularity). All of this is directly related to the specific objectives of the challenge, because we are looking to expand the use cases of the technologies of our ecosystem through Dapps, and as I said, the problem addressed is real and the solution seems very efficient (even Although the explanations were quite technical, I managed to get the general idea). With this, I believe that new members will be attracted to our ecosystem - artists, producers, distributors, in short, people who are part of the music industry and want to sign their copyright with complete security and transparency. This could contribute to the wide adoption of Cardano, in my opinion, and so the main goal of the challenge would be supported. \n",

      "The proponent cites what would be done through 3 milestones, each of which is a group of activities that must be carried out, all within a period of 2 months. I think we can, in a way, understand what's to come, but the time division issue could be better. How long should the activities that make up these milestones last individually? Some activities like “Study the Hydra Head protocol, understand the development status running the hydra node, play with the demo”, could be more clearly explained. How do you play with the demo, what would that mean in practice? Anyway, the script is not bad, but the activities to be developed could be detailed in a more objective and clear way, as well as the temporal division could better indicate how long each thing would take, theoretically. It would be appropriate if the bidder divided the time into weeks, specifying what would happen in each of them, or at the very least into months. Talking about the budget, the asking price is fair for the time and complexity involved in this project, but I notice some problems in this part of the proposal. First of all, all the requested amount would go towards the salaries of the 3 developers. They would earn 2500 dollars a month, in my opinion, a fair value and compatible with the market; it would be interesting for them to clarify whether they would work full-time or part-time. However, would only developers be paid on the project? It would be essential that other types of professionals were also part of the team or were remunerated fairly, such as designers, advertisers, etc. target Audience. In the team presentation part, which I will evaluate next, the bidder states that the team would be expanding, that new people would be hired. And how much will their payment be per month and where would this money come from if it is not requested in this financing? I got confused here, I think it would be really important for these details to be clarified. Now talking about the team, we are introduced to just 2 people; the information given about them is very satisfactory, that is, we know in detail who they are, what professional areas they work in, previous experiences and their linkedin profiles, so that a lot of confidence is given in their abilities to carry out this proposal. The problem is the same as what I mentioned in the budget division, we would need to know who the other professionals involved are, their names, resumes, in short, the same information we know about Mario and Alfredo; so that we could believe in the team as a whole. Therefore, I think the feasibility of the project is not adequate, having several things to be improved, even if some parts (such as the presentation of this duo) are satisfactory. \n",

      "I think the suggested auditability is average. It is said that a website would be created where the Cardano community could check when each milestone was completed, as a video would be made talking about it. It follows then, if each milestone is scheduled to be delivered in 2 months, that we would only have 3 updates during the total process (which is expected to last 6 months). I think this time is very little, very rarefied. I would like more information to be available on this same site, for example, monthly, to update us not only about the results obtained but also about what was behind it, that is, about the work routines of the participants involved, if the hours were fulfilled of work that were planned, if there were dissonances in the process and how they were overcome, etc. Finally, talking about the auditability of the final results, the proponent explains only what is expected as a result for the complete development of the technology, “a fully functional scenario of at least these actors: 1 Creator, 2 Co-Creators, 1 Claimant, 3 Litigants that complete a transaction by passing from tier2 to tier1.” They intend there to be “a command-line interface, but also a graphical interface”. Honestly, I found these explanations too technical and confusing, not making it possible for me to solidly understand what the success scenario is here. I would like them to explain in a simpler, more extensive and clear way what the finished platform would look like, as well as its use for each type of user. It would be essential for the proponent to trace tangible metrics that would be able to measure the impact of the project for Cardano. Did this platform actually attract new active members to the community (people in the music industry, for example)? How many users are using this application, have they somehow started to interact with other technologies in the Cardano ecosystem? And how could this be verified? I think that, in short, the proponent does not bother to make it clear whether the specific objectives of the challenge have been achieved or not. It would be necessary for this information to be collected and made available to the Cardano community, directly. The proponent claims that \"screencast videos\" will be published, but I don't know what that is, it would be nice if this was explained as well. Therefore, I think that part of the auditability of progress is good (but not ideal), and that of the final results leaves a lot to be desired, requiring a reformulation of this part of the topic. \n",

      "The proposal fits well with the objectives of the challenge, as it promises to promote face-to-face meetings in Ghana to discuss issues relevant to the Catalyst project. The number of purely African participants would be considerable, as they would be a large part of the public and the organizers, and the idea fits well with the questions of novelty and adequacy, since in the city there is not a good circulation of information about the community. The continuation of this project, which has already taken place in other African locations (such as Ethiopia) would be very positive, reaching the specific objectives of the challenge as it would disseminate knowledge about the Cardano Ecosystem. I believe that for Africa this would be very beneficial, as those involved would be exposed to a sea of ​​possibilities and opportunities; if they are from the technology area, they can seek to learn about the various technologies of our blockchain, such as the Plutus programming language, and with that, both education and future jobs will be the result of meetings, that is, an alternative would be presented source of income for them. If the participants of the events were not from the technology area, they would also benefit, as our ecosystem has a place for everyone, either through work as a CA, or through jobs that are not necessarily for those who work in the area. computing/technology, such as vacancies for game narrators, designers, writers, etc. While the Cardano ecosystem also benefited greatly, as this would generate a dissemination of our blockchain, more people would come to know about it, perhaps this could be reflected through some indications of the popularization of the blockchain such as Ada number purchased, NFTs minted , digital wallets created, Dapps in development and etc. This is all the more interesting given the following quote: the proponent says that “IOHK implemented a course last year in Accra to teach Haskel to 80 students. As this course takes off and your students with it, there is the perfect opportunity to synergize with networking events that have already proven successful in Ethiopia.” In other words, the chosen location is strong ground for future professionals working for Cardano. With this, I believe that the proposal is of high value and fits very well with what we are looking for in this challenge. \n",

      "The feasibility of the project is average, but the impression I got is that the proponent saved a lot of details in relation to the explanation of this part. There is no roadmap here, in fact what we have is a short text that summarizes what would happen if the proposal were funded. However, in order for us to accurately visualize the development process of this project, it would be necessary to prepare a detailed schedule. We know that the project is expected to last 1 year, I think it would not be necessary to include the complete roadmap with details of all these projects (although it is ideal), but it would be interesting if the organization process of at least 1 of these were detailed events. In this schedule, all the activities necessary for the development of this project should be described in detail, and separated by weeks (in this case, it would be 1 event per month, from what I deduce). Then we could know what would happen in week 1, 2, 3 and 4 of that month. Who would do what, how and for what purpose. In this way, the understanding of the process would be much more specific than the current one. Regarding the budget division, it is also done in a basic way, we know the approximate cost of each event (how much would the speaker cost, the rent of the place and etc). But two things crossed my mind here: wouldn't these values ​​vary according to who was speaking, and where the event would be held, etc? And the translation part, which is optional, if that money wasn't used, where would it go? Regarding the explanation of the team, this part is satisfactory, we know who those involved are and their professional occupations. However, this part could also be better detailed. We could have a better developed curriculum on each, so that we could get to know their previous experiences more richly; We know your linkedin profiles, so we can verify what is being said. The role of each one in the project could be clarified, this is a bit abstract too. I would like to know more about the involvement of those who already have proposals funded by Catalyst, such as what role they played in them, etc. So I think the feasibility is good, but it could be even better by adding a few more details. \n",

      "The auditability here is good, but it could be even better, from my point of view. A few more ways could be traced to perceive the success of the project beyond numbers. The proponent states that he will monitor whether the proposal was successful or not based on indicators such as the number of participants in the events, as well as the number of views on the content posted on youtube recorded on the day of the meeting, number of interested parties in the course launched by IOHK and etc. And the overall success would be if the local Ghanaian community explicitly increased their interest in the crypto world and especially in Cardano. I agree with these statements, but would like to suggest that a further survey be done with each participant of the events, so that we can understand if they are taking the Haskell course, or if they are participating in Catalyst, who knows if they became proponents, launching their ideas so that maybe they will be financed... It would be interesting to know if they shared the knowledge acquired in the events to more people, that is, if they helped to increase this current that we are trying to create, specifically in the African continent (as well as in India and Asia East, which are the target geographic locations for other challenges). In this way, we could observe, in addition to the number of people affected by the project, how they were affected. It is also important that we follow the proposal development process, not just the final results. The team of professionals involved needs to give some feedback to the Cardano community in a sporadic way, this contact can be done by preparing reports after the end of each event, saying how was the pre-production and the event itself. Was the speaker able to communicate well with the audience? Was there a translation? How many people showed up? These and other questions could be clarified. I think that in this case, a written report is the simplest and most objective way to update the community about the progress of the project, it could be sent to our telegram or discord channels, for example. In short, it is a very simple proposal to audit, just that this connection between the Cardano team and community is built and maintained throughout the process. \n",

Here, we are aiming to finance projects that work on the development of games that use our blockchain and the various technologies that the Cardano ecosystem has to offer, because it is undeniable how the gaming industry is extremely relevant and profitable in today's technology sector. The idea here is to promote a project in which artists can create products that would be in NFT format, minted on our blockchain, this NFT would be associated with the larger project World Of Pirates, a game that also aims to raise funds for the maritime cause. I think this fits in a lot of ways with what we are aiming for, as it will help a game that has involvement with Cardano to expand, it will make new people know about NFT and especially our blockchain, as the NFT concept is fine. famous nowadays, and it would also be beneficial for an environmental cause, that is: several advantages in a single project, which achieve different goals of our ecosystem. This project would also help to clarify an issue that is very important: many people think that all types of blobkchain work in the same way, that Cardano has the same development mode as Ethereum, for example, and we know that some cryptocurrencies and blockchain have a negative environmental impact indeed, but this did not happen to our ecosystem, so this project would also be useful to clarify this issue for those who are not yet well informed.

      "The feasibility of the project is good, although not perfect. As this is a larger project that is developing smaller projects in parallel, we have 2 projects already happening, from what I understand this third one would happen after the conclusion of them or at least one of them and who would decide these details would be the public. The proposal does not contain a very organized and detailed roadmap on which tasks would make up the whole, but it is possible to have a notion based on the information that was made available. If they were organized in a more linear, temporal and detailed way, it would be even better to visualize the process as a whole. However, we can get a sense of what is to come. Regarding the budget, I think the value is a little high, since it would only be a part of the larger project, an art competition, so I can say, I don't know why the jury payment would need to be 500 dollars, which their formations, what criteria they would use to select the winners and so on. The promotions part would basically take half the asking money, so I think it deserved to be more detailed, what would happen, how, when and by whom. Regarding the team, I think the level of detail is satisfactory, but it could be better, we know who they are and their roles in the project, but a small curriculum of each could have been provided and that could be proven in some way, via linkedin , I do not know.

      "This proposal fits perfectly with the objectives of the challenge, as it seeks to translate teachings on how to program in Haskell/Plutus for French speakers in Africa. The problem statement already makes it very clear what difficulties must be overcome here: “The Haskell/Plutus French curriculum is non-existent for Central and West African developers. This is a drastic obstacle to adoption.” Therefore, the idea is to continue the development of two previously funded ideas: Spread Plutus in Africa and Clubs + Hackathon = Cardano Adoption, which, despite not being so well explained, can be inferred from the context that it aimed to bring knowledge about the ecosystem Cardano, focusing on the programming language used in our blockchain, for this French audience from Africa. In my view, this is totally in line with the objectives of the challenge, because in it we seek to fund proposals that bring knowledge about our blockchain to a specific audience, so that their cultural specificities and their language are preserved and respected. This is exactly what happens here, and I think that the initiative should also be taken to other groups and other languages, because learning Plutus is still quite inaccessible to those who don't speak English. Therefore, I believe that the impact of this project has the potential to be maximum; I would like, however, that the subjects that will be addressed in these learnings were better detailed, how will such instructions be made available to the target audience? Through video classes, written texts, would they be face-to-face, online, hybrid meetings? Anyway, I really like the idea and I think it has a lot of future, but it still leaves a little to be desired in terms of detail, as I mentioned above, so I'll give it 4 stars; if the idea were more deeply explained and detailed, it would certainly deserve a top score, as the alignment here is undoubtedly perfect with the present challenge. \n",

However, this is not related to any notion of time, so we have no way of understanding the process well. They understand that for a script to be adequate, 3 things are fundamental: what will happen, when, and how? In this case, the only information we have is what will happen, we don't know if the activities of the first stage would take, for example, 1 month, or 2, or maybe just a few weeks... As well as the other parts. Therefore, I suggest that the proponents improve the script in this sense, associating the activities described with some temporality. Regarding the budget, I think the asking price is very fair for the complexity and scope of the proposal. 9,000 dollars are requested, and it is explained in which parts this total amount would be divided. We know the prices of translations and curation, including how much you would be charged for each hour of translation. Note that the requested value for this is higher than the average of translations, I say this because many Catalyst proposals suggest translating different contents, but I understand that translating teachings about Haskell is Plutus is much more difficult and requires more technique than translate, for example, Town Hall meetings. The only part that I think could have been better explained is team coordination. What would be the exact job for whoever would coordinate it? How many hours would this person work per week, to what extent would they commit to this project? Finally, let's analyze the team members involved in this project. A drive is available, but my access was denied, I believe the team forgot to configure access permissions for anyone with the link. Anyway, we have good information about the team members, just that some people provide better details about themselves than others. It is also a fact that some provide linkedin profiles and others do not. I wish everyone had given the same amount of detail about who they are, that way our understanding of the team would be more equal. I think it's fantastic that they are partners with the Wada group, as it is already a well-established and respected group on Catalyst for its various proposals that involve the African continent.

This is exactly what I always suggest to be done in relation to the auditability of the proposals, it is not enough to know what will be analyzed, we need to understand how the Cardano community will have access to such information, and in this case, both information is made available. Therefore, I have no criticism to make regarding that part of the proposal. Regarding the final result: the indicators that would serve to let us know that the main objectives were achieved are outlined, namely: “01 Haskell French curriculum ready to be taught throughout the Wada hub network + 01 Plutus French curriculum ready to be taught across the Wada hub network + Bilingual material (French, English) for our hackathon sessions + More than 21 French-speaking developers actively using the material to learn Haskell/Plutus in the first 6 months after publication.” These indicators are very important to have a more precise idea of ​​what the success scenario would look like, however, the proponents do not make it clear how this information would be taken to the Cardano community members, as well as they do in relation to the monitoring of the process. Would this be done via github as well? Or is it on another platform? Will the team develop any meetings with community members to explain whether the desired scenario has been achieved? Will there be participation of some French speakers from Africa, the target audience of the project? In my view, this is the only one that is pending regarding the auditability of this project.

      "The proposal is fully aligned with what we seek in this challenge. This is a group, called Cardano Baltic Hub, that will create a startup hub in Tallinn, Estonia. The objective is that workshops about our blockchain are promoted there, that a networking process is carried out between the local business community, that events take place that present to lay people what Cardano is and what blockchain is, as well as events with more advanced themes. that aim to make local companies adopt the technologies of our ecosystem. According to the proponents, they have already had contact with the local community, but it is necessary to increase the frequency and investment in these meetings, creating a permanent hub, so that the presentation of our blockchain can be strong and constant enough for startups and companies conventional companies choose to invest and build in Cardano. They also claim that other blockchains such as Ethereum and Solara are already being adopted for practical use, which creates the need for Cardano to be very well publicized and presented, as these entrepreneurs are likely not aware of the differentials and advantages that our blockchain has to offer. Therefore, I believe that the project has a lot of future and it makes a lot of sense to finance it, because a) we would not be starting from scratch. The proponents have already started this work, but it needs to be intensified so that the desired results are obtained b) from what we can see in the description of the proposal, local entrepreneurs are already open to the possibility of working with blockchain, but they still do not know Cardano c) the proponents already have a networking base, as I understand it, which can and should be amplified and strengthened. The only issue I found in the impact part of this proposal was: proponents should better specify the events they intend to promote. How often will they happen? What topics will be covered, and in what order? How will ordinary people and business people be captivated by participating in the meetings? How will they ensure that entrepreneurs understand the benefits of Cardano compared to the blockchains they are already embracing? I think it would be critical for them to have enumerated what topics they will cover, from introduction to blockchain to more advanced and specific subjects (eg use cases). If they had done that, the visualization of what is about to happen would be much more solid. In addition to the questions I raised, it would also be great if we knew who would be presenting the workshops and the estimated duration of each.

However, the explanations are superficial, the time division adopted by the proponents is quite extensive. Instead of reporting what would happen in the first 3 months, I think it would be better if they had told you what activities are planned for each specific month. As explained to us, we do not know if, for example, it would be necessary for an activity to be completed for another to be started or if parallel activities could take place. We don't know exactly how long each of these activities would take to start and finish. Some activities could be better detailed, I will give two examples to clarify my point of view. When bidders say “Connect with 5 startups and at least 2 VCs in the first three months”; How would these connections be made? Do they already have some startup options in mind that they plan to date? What would “VCs” be? In the part of “Hold weekly events, growing to more than 20 people per event”: as I mentioned in impact, what topics would be covered in each meeting? How would about 20 people be mobilized to participate in these moments? Some activities do not require further elaboration, but others would be better contemplated if small explanations were attached. Now let's analyze the requested budget. I thought this part is great, the total amount is divided into a few parts and each of them has its own explanations. For example, in relation to the salary of the community manager, we know the total amount paid and also how many hours he would dedicate to the project, so we are also informed of the value of his work hour. As in this case, the other parts of the funding are very well detailed, so I have no criticisms to make in relation to that. However, the team presentation was the part that left a lot to be desired in my opinion. I would think it would be more appropriate for them to already present the proposal with a defined manager, however, since they do not yet have this person, the selection process they would go through to be hired could be described. What kind of profile are you looking for? It would take someone very specialized in Cardano, how will they find this person in the locality? When proponents state that “There is no need for more people at the moment as we already have connections in the area who would be interested in helping and co-organizing events”, it would be very important for them to spell out what those connections are. Who are these people? How are they proposing to help the project? What are your previous works? Nor is direct information provided about the bidders themselves, what we know about them is what is said in “Summarize your relevant experience”; however, it is not specified who did what, their full names, and a very organized history is not given about each one individually. Therefore, I think the team presentation part and also the script should be improved. \n",

      "The auditability proposed for tracking progress is good, but mostly numerical. We know that to measure progress, indicators such as “Number of open wallets / Number of long-term holders / Number of wallets that have staked their ADA” and so on would be used; and that it would also be a goal that at least 3 startups adopt Cardano in their actions. However, I have two suggestions to make. First, in addition to knowing the goals for that period of time, it would also be important that we had the means to audit the tasks that were being carried out to achieve these goals. In this sense, I think that the proponents should prepare weekly reports with updates on the activities that were developed in that period of time, it would be important that they also include in these documents the numbers that they intend to monitor. This information should reach the Cardano community in some way, for example, the documents could be posted in the discord or telegram groups we have. I think discord would be best, as the proponents claim that channels will be created so that members of the locality where they will work can stay connected. Regarding the final results, the proponents suggest a highly explored scenario, which goes beyond numbers, but also has more qualitative goals to be achieved, such as opening new hubs in nearby locations. In my view, it would be necessary for them to take a look at all this information, and explore the part of startups adopting Cardano, because I feel that this is the root of the issue, and after they had all the information collected and organized, they would pass it on to the community. This can be done through a more extensive report, or also via a video call, during or after a Town Hall. If it is a report, it would be interesting to include graphical representations of the results, so that there are not so many texts and it is not so tiring for us in the community to read everything. In reality, how to bring this information to light is up to the team, I just want a bridge to be established between them and the Cardano community. I like the auditability here, I think the proponents gave due importance to this part of the proposal. However, it remains to be further clarified how all members of our ecosystem will be aware of all updates and final information. \n",

      "I found the idea interesting despite being quite ambitious. It is about creating a connection network between various hubs relevant to our ecosystem. According to the proponents, a series of activities would be developed here. They are intended, as I understand it, to help solve the difficulty of “making all information about the Cardano blockchain, applications, projects, ₳DA and other native currencies available in multiple languages”. They are also creating a website where “the content being built is primarily informational, covering all aspects of the Cardano Ecosystem and native currencies”. The idea involves many things, but I would say that it can be summarized in the creation of virtual hubs and also by the greater networking between the existing hubs at Cardano, it is said that one way to promote the success of the hubs is ensuring that the activities that each one group proposes to do can be remunerated, both in Ada and in the respective currencies of each country. I agree with this statement, I think Cardano is currently in a state of promise because we have many technologies but in a way it is still necessary to generate more articulation between the parties, so that all the groups together can work well in their respective areas and with that, the widespread adoption of our blockchain is promoted. That it can grow not only in terms of investment and volume of Ada, smart contracts, CNFTs and etc in circulation, but that more people can work through smart contracts minted at Cardano, that they can participate in companies that use our blockchain and that All of this has a positive impact on their lives. I believe that this proposal will, in a way, meet these needs, and with that, it is aligned with the objectives of the challenge. What really worries me here is that there are many activities, which would have to be done by many people, there are so many issues to be resolved that it causes me a bit of confusion if I really understood everything that is being proposed and especially how these things would be put into practice. Proponents cite: networking, better remuneration for those involved with projects at Cardano and a greater sense of sustainability... many issues are being addressed at the same time. Therefore, I think that if the proposal had more clarity on how each of them will be resolved (we know they will, but it's not as clear how, in my view), I would give the impact of this idea a maximum score. \n",

      "I don't think the proponents have presented a clear and concise roadmap, and at the same time puts us in detail about what will be done. We know very well which activities will be developed, the problem is that we are told that they would be carried out with funding from fund 8, but we do not know for how long they would all take together. We also don't know in which stages of the year they would happen (in which month and weeks), so it's not possible to have a linear view of the process to be built here. I would like the phase, as they call it, to be more detailed, in the sense that we know what would happen each month, who would do what, what weeks are planned for certain tasks to be performed, and so on. Therefore, I feel that the script needed a reformulation to make it more understandable, in terms of time. The proponents talk about a series of KPIs that can be used to monitor the proposed activities, but I will comment further on this in the auditability part. Talking about the team, we are introduced to 3 professionals, but we have different levels of information about each of them. For example, we don't know as much about Carl Henry as we do about the others involved. I would like his resume to be more detailed, given that he has so much professional experience (43 years). Now, in relation to the others, I thought that a lot of trust is passed on because we know their names, in a very detailed way their previous experiences, and for the 3 the linkedin profiles are made available, so that we can have a real proof of the information that is said. I think this part of the team is good, overall, my only observation would be to really improve the detail about Carl. Regarding the funding, we can find your explanation via a link provided which gives access to a google docs spreadsheet, I found this part to be satisfactorily detailed. We were able to get a good understanding of how the requested money would be used. Therefore, I think the feasibility is ok, but it can still improve in some aspects, such as the greater detailing of the script, in my view, the contents of the spreadsheet could have been posted in the description of the proposal as well, to facilitate. \n",

      "It is quite possible for us to audit the process already based on the extensive information made available on the feasibility of the activities that would need to be performed. We have enough KPIs here, in my view, the only thing that could be better specified is how the Cardano community could have access to such information. As important as providing ways to monitor the project, it is necessary that we know how to carry out this monitoring. We know that the team provides a link regarding the metrics, but will they always update this site? How often would it be updated? How would the Cardano community be aware of the updates, when attached? Would any member of the team let you know through the Catalyst general group on Telegram? Finally, it is necessary to clarify this doubt. Now talking about the measurement of success as a whole, they quote the site again, but I don't think the proponents define exactly what the success scenario would look like. I think the problem here is exactly what I said in the impact part, we have many things that are mentioned in this proposal, it is really multifaceted, I think that in order to understand if the general success happened, a study and a extensive research by the team. I understand it's something they intend to extend to future backgrounds, but I think it's necessary to situate the Cardano community on the completion of each of these phases. And I don't think there is such a thing here. Therefore, I suggest that the team rate more objectively how we can understand whether the final results were achieved, as accurately as they do with partial results. My opinion is therefore that the auditability is great on the progress part but very incomplete on the final scenario, so the team needs to review this topic. \n",

      "The proposal fits the objectives of the challenge, but more details would need to be provided about the project so that we could really assess its impact. We know, as the proponents say, that one of the best ways today to attract people to the crypto world and to our blockchain is through CNFTs, as the concept is on the rise and everyone (practically) is interested in it, in addition to of not being something so technical and complicated, such as, for example, understanding how a smart contract works, which makes it easier for people to fully understand and get involved with the thing. From what I can understand in this proposal, the CNFTs festival is already a reality in japan, probably this was a proposal launched in some previous fund and financed; it is clear that it is an event that brings together English and Japanese speaking communities, in favor of the purchase/exchange/exhibition of CNFTs. However, not much is specified about the festival, some doubts such as: if it is in person or online; if in person, where it takes place; who are these people who participate, who exactly is the target audience, we know that they are English and Japanese speakers, but this information could be more specific; we know what activities will make up this stage of the project, but what has happened so far in this festival, and how has the public reacted? Anyway, in general, I couldn't visualize as clearly how it would happen in practice, and with that I can't measure the impact it would have either. It certainly seems to me a proposal that would meet the objectives of the challenge, that both the expansion and popularization of the Cardano ecosystem, through the purchase of Ada/CNFTs, creation of digital wallets, new people becoming active members of the community, new smart contracts being brothers-in-law at Cardano and etc; and for the benefit of the geographic region in question, that is, East Asia, driving this territory to grow both economically, with a more social and human bias, as well as environmental and so on. This proposal seems that it will certainly popularize Cardano in Japan, through the dissemination of CNFTs, as well as benefiting its local population, since they would be getting to know and starting to consume a technology relevant to the system and will probably also research more about, and with this they will be able to enjoy the advantages and ease that our blockchain offers. That's why I'm going to give it 4 stars, because I think the idea is good but it should be better explained. \n",

      "We know in detail what will happen after funding, that is, what activities would be developed. This includes the theme of the conference, its dates, times and who will present it, which professionals will be involved. Really, the only thing that was outstanding in my opinion was the issue of location. All conferences would be and a single location, which one? Or would they be in different locations across Japan? Online, on which platform? It really isn't clear to me. I believe it will all be in the same corner, but I would like this information to have been confirmed, so that we could fully understand the project development process. Generally, I suggest that a script be established that includes exactly what will happen and when, I think this is already exposed in the proposal, another thing that could happen would be a greater detail in relation to pre-production, that is, what would be done before these meetings, so that it would become possible. However, this is just a suggestion on how to make the script even more fun, because the way it is is already very good. As for the other things, budget and staff, I think they're presented quite adequately as well. We know how the total amount would be split quite clearly, although this could have been further specified, for example when they ask for “$5000 - Hiring Video Production team and Video Graphics”, why would it take 5k for that? How many videos would there be, so what their individual price? Likewise, other expenses could also be better detailed. Regarding the team, in this case it is a duo, a lot of information is provided about them, which relate to professional CVs about what they have done so far and also how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem (it is not so explicit which it would be Timothy Vang's work in the community, though). I think it's a good level of detail so that we can get to know them, but their things were still missing, seeing: both a way to prove their CVs, either through a linkedin profile or some other platform that can prove the information said, how much to explain what the tasks of each would be, exactly. With this information attached, I believe we would be 100% sure who they are and if they are indeed equipped to perform these tasks. However, because this proposal is the continuation of another that already exists, a certain confidence is already transmitted in the team. For these reasons, I think the feasibility of the project is good, but to become ideal there are still things to improve. \n",

      "I don't think this part of the proposal is as good as the others. It's not bad, but it has a lot to improve. Only a few ways to monitor this project are given, which, in my opinion, are superficial. Basically, the suggested audit forms are through videos uploaded on youtube, which would be recorded from the event, and also by the festival itself. But these ways are very basic, I would like to suggest some improvements that could be made here. Regarding the development process, other ways could be created to monitor how activities are being developed. Before the festival starts, the pre-production would be carried out, this could be informed to the rest of the Cardano community if the two proponents elaborate some kind of return to the community. This could be done in several ways, such as establishing video calls, or even through office reports, in short, some way for us to make the information about the progress and preparation of activities for the festival to take place known. of all. Regarding the final results, I think it would be useful if, in addition to the event videos, the proponents made a summary containing basic information about each day: approximately how many people attended, how these people interacted with the speakers and also with each other, how they did captives of participating in the Cardano community and if so, in what way, in general: direct ways to understand how the days of the event itself were. In addition, further research could be carried out, some time after the event, so that we would know how these people would be getting involved with the technologies of the Cardano ecosystem, if they are acquiring, exchanging or exposing CNFTs, etc. This contact could be done by email, as a kind of satisfaction survey about the event and a way to deepen our understanding of its impact. Through these improvements, I think it would be possible to establish a more specific auditability, in the way it is suggested by the proponents, it would be a somewhat superficial follow-up, in my opinion. \n",

      "The proposal aligns perfectly with the objectives of the challenge because it promises to promote a series of teachings about the Cardano ecosystem for the residents of the African city Entebbe. I found this proposal very well written and organized, we know what topics will be covered in these teachings, the proposer claims that the explanations will be focused on different cases, as she cites, blockchain can be used for “DID integration, payment platform for public services, savings and loan products, land registrations and property rights” and so on. All this knowledge will be passed on to the city's inhabitants through an “awareness campaign through workshops and publicity”, which will be funded at a very low amount compared to what is asked for in most other proposals. It is positive how the bidder sees that the biggest challenge here would be to engage the locals of Entebbe to actively participate in the campaign, and how this will be overcome through marketing campaigns. This already demonstrates a certain maturity in relation to the process, the possible difficulties to be overcome and how the bidder has already thought about how to overcome them with her team. Another positive point is also that they have strong partnerships with groups that are already working to promote Cardano throughout Africa, the presence of networking is always an important thing, whatever the nature of the proposal. Therefore, I totally agree that the idea will achieve the specific objectives of the challenge, which are to benefit at the same time the African continent, introducing its inhabitants to what Cardano is and through that generating education and employment opportunities (mainly in the areas of business, programming and legal, which are the ones that need more manpower). At the same time, the proposal would make several people (if all goes well) enter the Cardano ecosystem, thus increasing the overall investment in our blockchain (buying and selling Ada, delegating to pools, buying CNFTs, building or sponsoring Dapps and etc), mainly because the bidder says that there are already potential future blockchain users in sight in the city. With that, I believe that the impact here would be maximum. \n",

      "The feasibility of the project is almost perfect. Regarding the script, we have a weekly time division, something rare to see. Generally, proposals divide the total time into quarters, but as this is a shorter proposal, the proposer explains for weeks what will happen, listing the activities, which I think is very good, as it gives us a very solid view of the process. . These activities could be even more detailed, in my view, but at the same time they are already satisfactory information. For example in the “advertise and promote the $75 event” part, in the third week, how would that be done? What are the marketing strategies to be adopted, how will the content that will be created be disseminated to the target audience? Regarding the budget division, less than 2 thousand dollars is requested, which is very rare here at Catalyst, I think the team involved was very honest and only asked for the funding really necessary for the activities to be carried out. We were able to understand in a very complete way how this money would be used, as it is divided into each of the activities, for example the announcement of the event, which I said could be better explained, by itself costs USD 75. I think it is possible We fully understand the need for the requested value. Regarding these two parts, the feasibility of the project is excellent, what I commented about being almost perfect was due to the team presentation. We know who the professionals involved are in a very basic way. The bidder attaches his linkedin profile, but does not explain in detail who he is. The other two team members already provide a brief explanation of who they are and their professional roles, but they also don't go into detail. It would be more appropriate if we had a more detailed explanation of who they are, what they have done professionally so far, how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem, what exact role they would play here and preferably that the 3 of them had attached their linkedin profiles. Therefore, if this part were increased, it would also give maximum grade for the feasibility of the project, as the other questions are commented in an ideal way. \n",

      "The proponent suggests some means of auditing the process, but I think his propositions are quite basic, there is no rigid plan for monitoring the process. And, from what I understand, the main goal is to reach 1000 people in this campaign. But beyond that, I think we would need to explore a few more things. Regarding the process, for example, I think it is necessary for a member of the Cardano community who is engaged with this process to closely monitor the progress of activities, or even one of the 3 team members to update weekly on how the process is going. project development process for members of the Cardano community. It would be interesting if this data collection were made available online so that all members of our community could access such information. This can be done through various platforms, such as google docs, miro and notion, for example. Regarding the final results, it would be important that, in addition to this numerical issue of how many people became aware of Cardano and its opportunities for use, it would be important to understand how they were reached. Did these people create DIDs, as mentioned? Did they acquire Ada? Are they participating in Catalyst? To clarify these doubts, the team members themselves could organize a meeting with some of the people who participated in this campaign, in order to understand what kind of activities they are currently developing. Or, an individualized form could be applied, trying to capture the impact of this campaign on their lives, as I explained earlier. In this way, we would have a more complete auditability, which would go beyond quantitative issues. I will give it 4 stars for two reasons: the proponent already presents us with some ways to monitor the process, even if basic; the presence of a very detailed roadmap makes monitoring the process more possible. With my suggestions, we can increase the level of auditability here. \n",

      "The idea is very good, it has some positive aspects and others not so much. Simply put, the proposal is based on making testing the purity of water (whether it is contaminated or suitable for use) accessible to everyone. People could test the water, through, as the author of the proposal puts it, “providing low-cost field test equipment and building a network of third-party labs.” They would build a Dapp, where this information would be stored on the Cardano blockchain. On top of that, whoever did these surveys/analyses would receive tokens as a reward. The author also states that in the future this project may become a DAO. In other words, only advantages for the Cardano ecosystem, countless positive points. However, what worries me is whether this proposal aligns exactly with the objectives of the challenge in which it was launched, since at no time is it emphasized how developing countries and the most disadvantaged populations would be targeted. Even to exemplify how the situation of water quality testing is precarious, the author cites the United States. Shouldn't they aim to promote good among the most needy? This challenge seeks to strengthen nations through improvements in “basic” sectors, such as health, education, security, identity, etc. Health would be the case here, something of course fundamental. But I believe that if the author gave examples of how economically disadvantaged communities would benefit from this, the objectives of the challenge would be better achieved. How could a person who doesn't even know what blockchain, Cardano, tokens, etc. be part of the project? Would this app be fully accessible to all audiences? That's why I'll give it 3 stars, I think the idea is very good, but it lacked focus on what we're really looking for in this challenge.

In these time periods, which activities would be developed are listed. It is a satisfactory way of understanding the process, but it is not exactly complete. We do not know, for example, how long each of these activities would last or who would work on them. Some parts are very well explained, such as the user registration. You can fully understand what things would result in that record and how people would use Dapp. The author also describes what would happen in the future on the part of future deliveries, it would be interesting to have a perspective of how long such things would take to happen (nothing exact, because I find it complicated to be so inflexible, but at least a projection of when the project would unfold). I think here would be a good space to explain how people who have never had contact with the cryptographic world would get to know, understand and use this Dapp. How could these people understand how digital wallets work in the first place? Anyway, the script is present, but it could be more detailed and include more explanations, such as the less educated public's adherence to cryptography. Regarding the budget, 115k are requested. A very high value! So I would like more detail as well. 45k for software development, the author even explains what would be done within this general block of activity, but I would like to know, for example, which professionals would be involved here, what would be the salary of each, how many hours of work they would have in total and how that time would be distributed. Likewise with the other part of the money, the 36k that would go towards various things, for example marketing. What would the strategy be adopted here? About the kits, how much would each cost? How would users go about accessing them? What about the reward token, how much would it be worth? Would it be enough to encourage people to do such an activity? Although there are details about the use of the money, even more would be necessary for us to have security in its use, since it is a very high amount. Regarding the team, there would be a total of 4 people, two of whom are already known: in this case, their presentations are very good, we know their names, roles and a little of what they have done so far, we also have linkedin profiles to prove the information said. However, the other two vacancies: it would be better if we already had selected professionals, since the investment here would be high, it would convey more security.

      "All data presented as process auditability are in relation to numbers. That is, how many monitored water collections, how much data uploaded to the blockchain, how many volunteers, etc. This works for us to understand how big the project is becoming, but I don't think it's enough for us to measure the human impact of the thing. It would be interesting to promote research in the selected areas in order to understand: did this project have a positive impact on the communities? Have people's lives been changed for the good? Did the volunteers receive fair rewards for their work? Did it help needy communities to support themselves better, live healthier? What happens when the analyzed water is unfit for consumption? Is there any kind of water treatment? I believe that the project team itself should promote these more qualitative analyzes and bring the results in a simple and direct way to the Cardano community. This can be done by preparing some reports, containing infographics, etc. It would also be necessary for the community to accompany the development of the project, if the volunteers would be able to understand how to use Dapp, if the steps were being carried out accurately. We know what would happen each month, so it is possible to monitor the development of the situation. Some community members could be responsible for this, and always be in touch with the project team. In general, the author provides us with quantitative data to audit the process, but I believe the analysis here needs to be more human than numerical. Now, speaking of the final results, the qualitative information that I talked about is provided. My question is more about how all this can be objectively monitored, how these consequences would become measurable and how the Cardano community could perceive them. In my view, it is necessary for the team to make this data scalable for us, making this information easy to understand. So the auditability is good, but it still has some details to improve. \n",

      "The proposal meets the objectives of the challenge well, because here we seek to create Dapps that are impactful for Cardano in the sense of attracting new active active members to the community, increasing the volume of Ada and CNFTs in circulation, in short, promoting the popularization of our blockchain. The idea in question is about creating a platform (from what I understand, it would be a mobile application), called “Artverse”. In short, it would be like an interaction between digital wallets, that is, users could see the NFTs that others have, interacting through likes, comments and shares (that is, web features2); and in the future, when the project evolves, some web3 functions will also be available, such as the integration of a Game Fi system. I found something very interesting because it is very geared towards arts and interaction between users, like social media itself, but I have some observations to make. First, would the amount of Ada (or other cryptocurrencies) in these wallets be hidden? Because I don't think it's interesting for this information to be shared, users probably wouldn't want that either. Second question: how would people find out about this new social network? I think that for a social network to become relevant, it needs to be very popular, many users interacting with each other and generating engagement; the issue of marketing in my opinion is always essential for the success of any project, but in relation to this one, it is even more so, so I wish the proponents had focused on that since the impact. Another thing, I think it would be interesting for proposers to conceptualize what a Game Fi system is, because not all CAs/proposal readers may be familiar with this concept. I personally don't know so clearly what this is, so I'd better understand what will be implemented from the one if the proponents had attached that explanation. It would be interesting for them to exemplify this with projects that are already being promoted today. I found it very positive that they attached a small video, very playful, that talks about the project, explaining in a direct and simple way what would be done. It's also great that they detail very well how Dapp would evolve according to the phases, punctuating the changes that would be generated, this makes us understand the evolution of the platform well. In summary, I liked the project, I think it is well aligned with the challenge because if this social network bursts, it can organically bring new members to Cardano, who can become interested in the functioning of our ecosystem and get involved with other technologies pertinent to our blockchain. Therefore, I will give it 4 stars, if some doubts that I explained were resolved, the note would have been the maximum. \n",

      "The attached schedule is satisfactory, although it could have been more detailed. We know that phase zero would start after funding and end at the end of the second quarter of this year or the beginning of the third quarter. We also know which activities will be developed and how many weeks they would last, approximately. I found the temporal notion to be very well established, however, the detailing in relation to some activities themselves could be more in-depth. For example, in “UI/UX Design”, we know into which parts this task would be divided (“Lo-Fi Wireframes” and “Hi-Fi Wireframes”); we are also informed of the progress that has been made so far, through the link that is made available from google docs. That is, on this task, we have a very solid understanding of what has already been done and what will be done next. However, in “Technology”, this activity is only conceptualized as “Fullstack Web and mobile dapp”. Non-tech people like me don't fully understand what this means. It would be interesting for proponents to attach an accessible explanation of what Fullstack web would be and why it would take around 12 weeks to develop, along with the mobile Dapp. Now talking about the budget, we have to keep in mind that the requested money would only cover the expenses of the zero phase of the project; It would be interesting for bidders to let us know when it would need to be spent in total, with the development of the other phases, and if they will try to fund future Catalyst funds or try to raise the money in another way. The budget explanation is satisfactory, we know into which parts the total amount would be divided. As with the roadmap, some of them are better explained (eg “Fullstack Mobile Dapp Development: 360 hours @ $35/h = $12,600”. We know how much the hourly rate would cost for this task), while others are just quoted (such as “Web Dapp Development: $10,000 flat fee.” Why is this fee flat and why does it cost $10,000?). Overall, I found the budget explanations to be good, but it would be ideal if all parts were explained in the same level of detail. Finally, speaking of the team, I think this part is average. We do not have the same level of detail regarding all team members; Ideally, everyone would have presented their names, a short resume (with previous experience included) and their linkedin profiles, so that we could know their careers accurately. It also worries me that only Sam Jeffrey seems to be a member of the Cardano community, having studied Plutus, it is not clear if other people would be used to dealing with the technologies pertinent to our blockchain. So, I think the auditability is ok, it basically provides us with everything we need to know about how to carry out the project, but it could be better detailed. \n",

      "Proponents provide good ways for us to measure the progress of the process. According to them, weekly meetings will be held with the Cardano community through Discord (I understood that these meetings would be directly for community members, but maybe they are with some IOG coordinators, I don't know). I think they are quite right when they say that the feedbacks will be qualitative and quantitative, because in my view it is essential that we analyze the projects to be developed in these two ways. It is also important in my view that we can be aware of the work routines of those involved, so here's the suggestion: in these meetings, in addition to presenting partial results, proponents can update participants on whether there was any dissonance in their work plans , and if so, how it was overcome. They provide the link to discord and also state that the gitghub repository will be open so that we can check the more technical issues directly. In other words, in my perception the auditability of the process is perfect. Talking now about monitoring the final results, success will be considered when the platform reaches 100 thousand users and also by the indicators “bring user ownership of social media platforms and use to earn savings” and “implementing Participatory Decision Making ( PDM) in the user economy”. I think the proponents only focused on Dapp, when in fact we also need to understand how this project would have consequences for Cardano. I would like them to outline measurable ways for us to know if the specific objectives of the challenge were achieved, if Dapp contributed to the popularization of Cardano and what that process was like; if the number of Ada being bought and delegated has increased, if more people have become active members, if there has been an increase in the minting of NFTs on our blockchain and so on. It is important that all this is studied and properly reported to our community, it can be through discord itself, which is the bridge they will establish. Finally, like the other topics in the proposal, this one is good, just needing some improvements. \n",

      "This project is exactly what the challenge is looking for. The idea is to carry out a professional report with information about Ada, Cardano and other technologies that involve our ecosystem and broadcast it in consolidated newspapers in Vietnam. I believe that everything we are looking for in the challenge is found in this proposal, even if it is relatively simple. It doesn't take complexity to successfully achieve the goals of all challenges, and the task in this challenge is clear: expand Cardano-related content into new forms of media in order to reach different types of audiences. As the author of the proposal himself says and also as he is present in the explanation of the challenge, on youtube we already have a good base, but the audience that consumes this platform is certainly not the same that sees the national newspaper. And we want to reach as many people as possible, get out of the bubble. I think this will work, because from what I've already noticed along the funds, especially in fund 7, several proposals were about Vietnam, the cryptographic community there seems to me promising and in my view the impact of this proposal aligns perfectly with what the challenge asks for. The author considers it as a challenge that there are not enough people to do research on Cardano and Ada and that they do not find an opening to expose this content in a more traditional media, yes, in fact, these are problems that we can face with the project, but I believe that they can be overcome and totally worth investing in this proposal. \n",

      "The author of the proposal provides a good roadmap, where the activities that will make up the whole project are listed. It is positive how he establishes phases and divides activities over time. We just needed to know in which month all this will start, which month is expected that phase 1 will end, that phase 2 will begin and so on. This is the only missing point for understanding the process; otherwise, everything is as it should. The explanation of the budget is very detailed. $10,000 is asked, and we understand a lot of specifics about how that amount would be divided. We are told in great detail how each part would be divided, for example: “Survey Activity (Make a survey and collect questionnaire and analysis results) - 40h * $40 = $1,600 - (40 hours working and 40$/hours) . Thus, the need for such an investment is very clear. In fact, I think the value is not high, compared to other proposals, but it is still fundamental that we understand the need for this amount of money, as it is done. The author divides the total amount into smaller parts and argues the need for each one. With that, we would have more confidence in the need for such an investment, giving us complete security about this part of the proposal. And finally, regarding the team, we are presented with its leader and the leader of the communication part. In relation to this duo, we also have a lot of information, such as their previous experiences and their linkedin profiles, so it also conveys a lot of confidence in their ability to successfully carry out the project. Therefore, the feasibility is very good, we know in detail all the fundamental information - about script, budget and team (in this case, about the duo) - and with that, it is possible to understand very precisely a) what would be done b) when would be done c) how it would be done d) by whom it would be done e) how much each specific part would cost f) who are the people involved and why they are prepared and qualified to carry out the proposal satisfactorily and successfully. \n",

      "The author views auditability with mostly numerical data. It would be necessary that we had a qualitative analysis, in addition to the quantitative one. It is certainly important to analyze in numbers how many downloads the report had, the number of newspapers that will accept it and so on. But it would also be interesting, for example, to carry out research in order to understand whether the expected impact was achieved after this project. In other words, has there been a change in view of cryptocurrencies in the country, especially Ada? Were the inhabitants interested enough to look beyond, to research Cardano? Has our blockchain caught mainstream media attention beyond the report in question? It would be important for the project author to gather this data and take it to the rest of the Cardano community. Another thing: we need to follow the phases to know if the process was being done as promised. This is quite possible to do based on the information given by the author. It would be interesting if a member of the community that inhabited Vietnam would follow up this closer, on a constant basis. This information would also need to be brought to the rest of the community, it could be through some discord channel aimed at tracking funded proposals, for example. In general, the author outlines good forms of auditability, but I don't think they are entirely sufficient to safely face the whole project result, beyond the numbers. My opinion is that yes, the proposal is quite auditable, however this auditability could be even better if he had provided more qualitative information also for the analysis of the process as well as the final results, as I suggested during the evaluation of this topic. \n",

      "I thought the game idea was quite daring, it could be that it works very well or that it is a project that is a little too ambitious. It is about promoting an “information war”, in which one side would represent people with a more traditional mindset (“censorship, fact-checkers, legacy media, surveillance”) and the other a more modern and technological generation (“the opponents will use memes, independent media, encrypted messages and other tools to circumvent censorship”). In this case, from what I understand, one side would try to make the other lose credibility in the face of some problem situation, some information to be commented on. The idea is quite interesting, in fact, although it can cause controversy. The proponent seems to already be aware of this and the game will be \"anti-fragile\", so to corrupt it would require people to undergo a new learning process every time. Okay, here's my opinion: I have my insecurities about this project directly meeting the objectives of the challenge. Starting with the fact that the idea is presented, but the gameplay is still a little vague. It is not mentioned how a match of this game would be in practice, how these teams would be defined, the part of what actions they would face. It's not as clear how to pass the level, or even if that would be a feature of the game. We don't know how each match would be promoted. Another problem is that the proponent doesn't explain exactly how Cardano's technologies would be used here, we know it would be a decentralized game that would probably act with some DAOs and transactions on Cardano's blockchain, I think CNFTs would also be traded here, I can't imagine what way Ada can be commercialized, anyway, it is a little uncertain in my perception how all this will develop. In other words, I don't see direct explanations about how the technologies of our ecosystem would be used, and this makes me a little insecure about the goal of popularizing and expanding Cardano through games and the highly engaged gaming audience. \n",

      "The roadmap provided is rather superficial. The time division is adequate, I generally evaluate it as the best option that the total time is divided into months (the best case would be to divide these months into weeks, but this is not always strictly necessary). The problem here is really the explanation of the tasks, the activities are described in a superficial way, we don't know the details of the actions to be carried out each month, and this makes it difficult to fully visualize the process. Therefore, the roadmap could be revised in the sense that more extensive and detailed explanations were provided for each of the phases. Now speaking of the budget, something similar happens, we know how the total amount would be divided, however this division is also somewhat summarized. These are the salaries of the professionals involved (developer, designer and product manager). We know how much each one would earn per month, in my view the amounts requested are compatible with the market, the problem is that we do not know if they would dedicate themselves fully or partially to the project. It would be interesting to know the number of hours they would work on this game, so that we have an idea of ​​the price of each hour of work. About the team, we have some information about the developer and the product manager. We know their names, a short summary of their CVs and their linkedin profiles. Despite not being the most detailed explanation possible, trust is still passed on them, especially because in the case of the developer he works with Plutus, so we know that he is already well placed in relation to Cardano's technologies. The problem is really on the part of the designer, it would be much better if they had already closed the negotiations at the time of submitting the proposal, so that we could get to know the team completely and thus have even more confidence. I think the feasibility is good, as much as the script and budget are superficial, we generally know everything we need to understand what would be done, by how much and by whom, with some improvements needed. \n",

      "The proponent states that “development progress will be tracked using an agile methodology and weekly team meetings”; it would be important for us to know what this methodology is and also if the contents discussed at the meeting would be accessible to the Cardano community. I don't think it's so necessary that we know weekly updates, but monthly I believe it's important. The quantitative indicators chosen by the bidder are great for understanding the partial results, being “the total number of pull requests on Github, the total number of commits on Github and the total number of bugs fixed”. Again, I reinforce: it is important that all this is gathered in monthly reports and that these are made available to the Cardano community. It would also be perfect for the proponent to summarize a little bit about the team's work that month, so that we have an understanding of the tasks done, in addition to the goals achieved. Talking now about final results, the proponent explains in an extensive and detailed way what the success scenario would be, I think we are very good situations in relation to how the game would be considered a success. However, I noticed that in his explanations the proponent does not make it so clear how the benefits to Cardano would be measured. I would like him to pay more attention to this, as the purpose of the challenge is to promote the creation of games that can help our blockchain grow, become popular, be widely adopted so that new members are added, the investment in Ada grows. and etc. In summary, I liked this auditability, I think it is very well underway, few improvements are needed to make it ideal. \n",

      "This proposal is very interesting and totally fits the challenge to which it was submitted. In this challenge, we seek to finance projects that do not fit into any other challenge of the fund, but that are still of high value to Cardano, helping, in some way, our blockchain to grow, become popular and be adopted by different initiatives/people/ companies and etc. The idea here is to provide a paid internship in the area of ​​human resources, in which the intern would work at the company Loxe Inc., which is a remote company that uses Cardano’s blockchain to develop its projects. I see many positive points for which we should finance this proposal. 1) Indeed, as the proponents say, Cardano and blockchain in general still offer few opportunities for professionals who are not in the fields of technology (programming, design, etc.), law or business. Human resources students are certainly a key part of our ecosystem, as they can become professionals who help the company in non-technical issues when it comes to technology, but in relation to the behavior, satisfaction and performance of the professionals employed. I think that as important as having professionals trained in a technical way, is that we also have people with the appropriate psychological profile for the position in which they work; people who are satisfied with their work, so that they do their tasks willingly and carefully; people who get along well with their bosses and co-workers. It is also essential that these people can be selected in the most humane and fair way possible, that is, I truly believe that professionals in this area are fundamental to the success of any company, this also includes those who work with Cardano. 2) The second positive point I identified here is the company itself (Loxe Inc.). I believe that this company is of high value to our ecosystem, since it is made up of competent professionals who have already shown service through tools for their own community or projects that were financed through Catalyst and are currently in operation, such as the Win platform. win. I think this team will probably make a great introduction to their interns about what blockchain is and what are the differences and advantages of Cardano over other blockchains. This will certainly generate future professionals who will remain in the community, contributing to the realization of projects that will make Cardano widely adopted in the near future, if all goes well. Anyway, I think that the proposal will have a very positive and considerable impact for Cardano, really deserving the maximum score in this regard. \n",

      "The roadmap for this project is very simple, but as it is not such a complex proposal, it is possible to fully understand what will happen based on the information given. The months of August and September would be destined for the dissemination of the internship. One suggestion I can make to the proponents is that they specify where this disclosure would take place. Would it be through sites like linkedin, communication channels in our community, like Discord and Telegram? Afterwards, the months from October to December would correspond to the stages themselves. I think it would also be nice if the proponents explained which projects they intend to involve their interns in. In other words, the script is good, but in my opinion it could have given a little more detail, so that we had a deeper understanding of what is to come. Still, as I said, it is very clear what activities will be developed and when, due to the simple nature of the proposal. In terms of funding, USD 9,000 is requested, which, in my opinion, is quite consistent with the magnitude and benefits that this proposal will generate for Cardano. We know very well how this money would be used: for interns' grants, payment for training provided by Loxe Inc.'s professionals, equipment (computers) given to university students, etc. About this part, I think the presentation of the information was adequate, I don't think it would be necessary to go into more detail. Finally, speaking of the team, it is the team of Loxe Inc: Matthias Sieber, Ganesh N, Victor Corcino and Eli Selkin. Total trust is passed on in this team, since we have a good level of detail about their careers, we know in which area they work as well as what jobs they have developed previously. As I said about the impact, because it is a company that already executes projects that involve Cardano's technologies, a lot of confidence is automatically passed on in its ability to carry out the project successfully. They are experienced and highly qualified. Therefore, I think the feasibility of the project is great, my only suggestion would be to delve a little deeper into the script, but there is no lack of information so that we can solidly understand what will be done, nor by whom or for how much money, so I will give it a note. maximum once again. \n",

      "Regarding the process, the proponents explain very well how the small advances of this project will be audited. They state that “we will use the Agile methodology to manage and track our progress in the development of this project”. That is, they have already defined a way of organizing, planning and auditing the small steps that they will need to follow so that the desired partial results are obtained. My suggestion here would be that they explain a little about the Agile methodology, which I believe, like me, most readers of the proposal are unaware of. It is very clear how they will make the Cardano community and the IOG coordinators aware of the small progress: through reports and monthly meetings, which I believe will contain updates both on the tasks that would be being done in that period of time and the partial results obtained. . Now, talking about the final results, I think the proponents also give enough information about how this could be measured by the Cardano community. We know what the main goal is: that two interns from the human resources area are working and learning about Cardano in practice, and with that they become active members of the community and contribute to the development of future projects. We also know specific KPIs that make this objective measurable, such as “Number of applicants per vacancy: > 10 + Number of interns selected: 2”. My suggestion here is this: it would be very positive if the team at Loxe Inc. (it wouldn't have to be all of them, just a few professionals or even just one) make an overview after the internship period, reporting how the experience was and how the interns showed interest in Cardano and how they will act for the community from now on . I think that autability here is very safe, even because it is a simpler proposal, so it is also simpler to monitor it, and I also think that the proponents make it very clear how the bridge between them and our community will be; that is, everything is in order. \n",

      "I think the idea is good and fits very well with the objectives of the challenge, although it could be a little more specific in relation to what subjects will be addressed in the project to bring knowledge about Cardano to the chosen target audience. The purpose here is to translate content relevant to the Cardano ecosystem into French, as according to the proponent most people in Africa think that blockchain is synonymous with betting on cryptocurrencies. I think this reality is quite possible because where I live the situation is similar, so it's really very important that we work to undo this stereotype. However, it gets a little confusing how this process would be done. Face-to-face and online meetings will be held; Catalyst School documents will be translated (which is very positive, as they have a great repertoire so it makes more sense to take advantage of what already exists than to create explanations from scratch; some sort of partnership will be made with the WADA group, which is another well-respected group on Catalyst for having several projects underway in the recurring challenge on Africa, however, it is not explained so exactly how this partnership would be established. provided / Adoption of Cardano apps will be promoted / 24 successful events will be held in 6 months), it also tells us exactly what topics would be covered in those events. However, this is done quickly on the topic of feasibility. Thinking more about Therefore, I believe that at first they would be more general concepts such as, for example, what is blockchain, what is the difference between Cardano and the others s blockchains, how to create a digital wallet and etc; and then there would be more specific topics for the more technological members, say, of the groups that are intended to carry these translations. It would be very positive if the tenderer had attached, for example, some documents that she intends to translate from the Catalyst School. Now, speaking more directly about whether the proposal aligns with the challenge's request, I sincerely believe so, because here the intention is to popularize Cardano among a specific audience and that is precisely what the proposer does. She will work in the target audience's mother tongue, and this will certainly help a lot in the learning process. I think this proposal also speaks to the challenges of Africa and the new members on board. An observation: I would very much like the video that was attached to be subtitled, I would certainly be able to understand in more depth what would be being done here if this had been done. \n",

      "I believe the script could have been a lot more detailed. Starting with the fact that the bidder divides the period of time into blocks of 3 months, delegating various activities that would be developed in that period of time. I don't think this is the best way to organize the timeline because the intervals chosen are very long, so we don't understand how these activities would be organized within the quarters. I am also in favor of a greater detail regarding the activities presented. For example in the first quarter there would be an “Ada donation”, but to whom and why? Regarding the workshops, the proponent states which subject would be addressed in each, but things could have been informed such as: the duration of the workshops (both online and face-to-face); how would the daily schedules be organized, for example, would it be a lecture followed by a coffee break and networking? Workshop topics should also be better arranged. For example the following topic, present in the second phase of the project: “More details about the Cardano blockchain”. What details? How in-depth will be done? How will people who are involved in the project be captivated to participate? Now let's move on to the next topic of analysis: the budget. A total amount of 16 thousand dollars is requested, this amount, in my opinion, is quite fair for the number of events that will be promoted and also for the time the project will last. I just think the use of this money should be explained more. For example, $10,000 is asked for “salary for local event organizers and workshop donors”. But how many would these organizers be? What would be the salary value of each of them, individually? How many hours would they work? That way we would know the price of their working hour. $5,000 would go towards “Event Logistics, Venue Costs, French Materials, Food etc” – that's a lot, so we'd need to understand how much would go to each part as well. So I think that part of the feasibility really deserved improvement. And finally, speaking of the team, I believe that this part is average because we have more information about Laurentine than about Kodjo, ideally we would have as much information about one as about the other. It would also be important that they made their linkedin profiles available so that we could see their past experiences in practice. However, there is a certain confidence in the duo, since we have some information about their professional areas and a small curriculum of each. I conclude then that the feasibility is, but could be better detailed in general, especially in the part of the script and budget. \n",

      "I think the auditability of the process is very superficial. The proponent points out that this would be measured by producing an average of “20 active Cardano users every month”. However, in my view, monitoring the progress of the project is more complex than that. Let's see, we have a series of tasks to be carried out each month, so the ideal would be for the Cardano community to be able to audit each one of them. A series of workshops would take place, so another point we need to monitor is how each of these events took place. For this, it would be necessary for some more details to be provided, such as: what activities each month (as I said before my evaluation); the exact schedule of each workshop, in addition to the teachings themselves (as I have already mentioned). It would be important that somehow the translation of Catalyst School documents was also evaluated. So I think it's a good idea that any member of the Cardano community who is interested and willing to audit this proposal do so, preferably speaking English and French to also check the document translations part. This person could monitor the development of activities, both in terms of tasks (what would be done) and goals (what would it be done for, and here comes the metric of 20 new community members per month). Now speaking of the final results, I also think that the proposer's suggestions were superficial, unfortunately. I think that because it is based a lot on numbers: how many workshops took place and how many new active members for the Cardano community were gained. This is important, but it is also necessary to analyze more qualitatively the consequences of this project. How are workshop students engaging with Cardano? Are some working as CAs? Are those more techies delving into how to build smart contracts, create Dapps? What is happening to these people? I think that as this information was collected, automatically the impact of the project on our blockchain would already be perceived. All this information needs to be conveyed in a simple and concise way to the entire Cardano community. Finishing my auditability review, I really think it needs to be improved, more in-depth in several aspects. \n",

      "This proposal can be summarized as “proposing the PIE (Proposal Implementation Assessment) framework with criteria and indicators to assess the compliance and performance of proposals financed by Fund 8”, where in this structure “they are used to assess the degree of compliance with the goals, commitments, KPIs/metrics established in the proposal”. Theoretically, this proposal fits perfectly with the specific objectives of the challenge, from the moment it proposes to create this new method of auditing proposals, based on the aforementioned indicators. Proponents argue that as funds go by, the number of proposals being funded grows too high and it is difficult for IOG to fully audit them. I agree with this preposition, because that is precisely why this challenge was launched, and I think that coming up with this P.I.E structure is a good way to solve the problem. However, I think the bidders could have done better to explain how the audit would happen in practice, how this structure would be used to evaluate the bids. In my view, this could become clearer if they, for example, took some proposal and applied the audit through this structure. Thus, we would see how this would happen in everyday life, and we would better understand the strategies used. Therefore, my conclusion is: this proposal addresses very well what we are looking for in the challenge, as it suggests a more standardized and probably more practical way of auditing the growing number of proposals financed by each fund, but from the explanation provided in the detail of the proposal, I cannot solidly visualize how this audit would be done, even though they brought up many issues that would be evaluated in the “specifically, the implementation of this proposal will contribute to the success of this Challenge in the following KPIs” section. With that, the impact is a little affected, I still believe it's a good idea and that it will work, but because I don't understand exactly how, I don't feel comfortable giving full marks to this topic of analysis. I would also like to know how the auditing of the proposals that they encompass as “community development” would be different from the auditability they would do, for example, in the game challenge.

      "The feasibility of this proposal is well above average, I think it deserves top marks. Starting with the fact that we have a very strong script: first, a period of time is established, for example, from month 1 to 3, in which various activities would take place. These activities are described below. I think the way it is presented to us, the script conveys a lot of confidence in the process, as apparently the team has already planned and organized what would be done very precisely. What could still improve, in my opinion, is if this time division were monthly in all cases, since the first three months are still considered together, so that a very detailed linearity was explained to us, which would increase even more. more the level of understanding in relation to the construction of the process. Regarding the budget, I think they ask for a fair value that is compatible with the complexity of the proposal, and unlike most proposals, the proposers do not reserve an exclusive session to talk about the budget. They do this already tied to the script, which is very good, because we know that certain activities would cost an amount X, and that already allows us to have a very good understanding of how the requested funding would be used. Even in terms of working hours, we know how much each small part of the whole would cost, how much time to perform each task would cost, that is, I think this part of the budget is very well explained as well. Finally, the team presents its members in a very complete and detailed way. First they say their names, main functions, attached a series of profiles of social networks, including linkedin, that is, we have a way to prove what is being said, and finally a small (but satisfactory) explanation of what they have been doing is attached. So far, what are your previous experiences and so on. Apparently it is a very well qualified team that is fully capable of carrying out this project successfully. So I think the only thing I suggest to make the feasibility even better is that the script be organized on an even smaller timescale, increasing the level of specification. Other than that, everything is in order, apart from the fact that the team has strong partnerships with other teams already funded (I know the team's proposals 2 minutes review and it really is a very interesting work). \n",

      "The auditability of the proposal is good, but I don't think it's ideal. The team is concerned with providing various KPIs and statistical data that can serve as material to analyze for measuring progress. However, how will this data reach the community? It is not feasible that such things are defined and that they do not have a direct path to reach the members of the Cardano community. Therefore, I think it would be necessary to think of ways to make such information always available and updated, in addition to being visible to us. The team can create some online tool, such as Miro, Notion, Google Docs, etc., that serve to host such metrics and make them reachable for members of the Cardano community. Updates could be made monthly or weekly, and these directly posted there and forwarded to the community through Discord, Telegram or other communication channels we already have. Regarding success and final results, I believe that more or less the same thing happens: we know the ideal scenario to be reached, but we don't know how we could visualize it. In this case, as the information is more extensive and requires a further level of detail, I think it would be necessary for the team itself to contact the community in order to summarize everything that has been achieved. This can be done through synchronous online meetings, participation in Town Hall, for example, or even videos recorded and forwarded in the community media that I have already mentioned. In this way, I believe that auditability would be better explored and ensured, and that we would have more control over project monitoring. \n",

      "I think the proposal is super relevant and will have a high impact for Cardano. DLT360 is a company that provides a kind of consultancy for companies that want to enter the blockchain universe, I think the role they play for our community is super important, since there is still a lot of prejudice and misinformation about what blockchain is. , cryptocurrencies, etc. I think most people, especially in places where this technology is not widely adopted, see the cryptographic world as an “easy and quick way to get rich”; we know that's not it, obviously we believe in the appreciation of Ada over time but there are many projects and many benefits about Cardano, as we active members of the community know. The role of DLT360 from what I understand would be precisely to better explain what the cryptographic universe is to different people and companies, they outline very well the goals they intend to achieve, for example in the topics: “ensuring that the millions (billions) are invested wisely + having the main trends, risks and opportunities precisely analyzed and visualized (collecting from various sources) + demonstrating this care to regulatory bodies and professional clients (...)”. The objective of this proposal would be precisely to make these services more accessible, transparent and auditable, as we can infer from the excerpt “we will make one more iteration in the design of our material (presentations, videos) and we will fully integrate the access of Radar DLT360 in our WEBsite”. In other words, the services that are already being provided will be improved, in this way the quality will increase and the results, of course, will also benefit. While the company is already working to promote the popularization of our blockchain for different groups, automatically they are already dialoguing with the objective of this challenge, which is to provide greater Cardano adhesion, the popularization, knowledge and appreciation of our technologies ( even if this is not done as specifically as in the other challenges). For these reasons, I consider this proposal to be of maximum impact. \n",

      "The way of explaining the script was not conventional, at first the proponents explain in a very long and detailed way how each aspect of the company develops, that is, the type of work they perform, from what I understand, being these: \" customer segments/target groups + value proposition + distribution channels + customer relationship + revenue streams). Up to this point of the topic, I was a little confused because I did not see the development phases being addressed from the current funding, however this doubt is resolved in topic 6, exactly which activities will be performed are said (from the third quarter of this year ) specifically at this stage of work. We know what will happen in a very well explained way, my only observation would really be that time is divided on a smaller scale, for example in months; if the bidders told what would happen in each of them, our visualization of the whole process would be more accurate. Turning now to the second topic of analysis, the budget, I think this part looks great. The asking price is compatible with the size and complexity of the project, and it is well explained, some parts are separated and these are detailed; for example in “general project management, MIRO updates (5 hours for USD 50/h) = USD 250.00”. We know exactly what would be done (management), by where (via the MIRO app) and for how many hours this would be work, as well as the hourly rate. The other parts are also explained satisfactorily. Finally, let's talk about the team presentation. I thought this part was good, however the descriptions of each member of this team could be a little longer, they could have explored each one's CV more, reported better past experiences and how they relate to Cardano (we know they are active members of the community, but it would be interesting to know about other projects they are involved in besides this one). It is good that your linkedin profiles have been provided, because with this we can verify all the information that has been said. In summary, I found the feasibility good, having only a few points to improve. \n",

      "I believe that everything is in agreement regarding the auditability of progress, both because the team of proposers is already familiar with the processes of monitoring Catalyst proposals (reporting, I believe meetings with the IOG coordinators as well) and because they provide several KPIs, which can serve as a direct way by which we can verify that partial results have been achieved. I think the bridge with the Cardano community would be through MIRO itself (it is not so clear whether it would be viewable by other people or only by team members), or through the aforementioned reports (if these would be forwarded to the Cardano community by telegram, discord and etc). As much as everything was not so explicit, I think that things would work that way, so I can be confident about the good follow-up of the process. As for the final results, the proponents provide KPIs similar to the auditability of the process, which are the performance of the activities mentioned in the roadmap, number of views on the website and RADAR and ratings. What could have been better clarified would be precisely how the Cardano community would track these metrics. Would it be through MIRO and reports as well? Or, because they are the final conclusions, so they would probably be more extensive explanations, would the proponents be part of some Town Hall, where they would expose the verified contents? I think auditability is good, but it could be a little better in that sense of bridging the Cardano ecosystem. Apart from that, I think that the data provided by the proponents is enough for a good monitoring of the evolution of this project. \n",

      "This project is very interesting and relates well to the objectives of the challenge, which are to create games that use the various technologies of the Cardano ecosystem (as in this case, NFT) to popularize our blockchain, so that new players get to know their characteristics and advantages and can, preferably, become active members of the community. I think this game is meeting the requirements very well, for several reasons. Starting with the fact that it is not a game aimed at an audience that is already used to the cryptographic world. It is noted that it is a kind of virtual pet, a type of game that could attract the most diverse audiences, including children, since, as the proponents themselves say, it would not be a game with difficult gameplay (this would vary - you can start playing without having many skills but could evolve a lot). This is very important when it comes to ensuring that a large audience would be compatible to start playing. It also facilitates the fact that no one would need to pay or already have NFT to start here, which would be a free entry point for those who still don't understand blockchain, don't know what NFT is and etc. As the authors put it, it would be possible to “convert players (who are already digital natives) to blockchain natives as well”. And with that, more and more people would get to know Cardano and the goals of the challenge would be achieved. Another positive thing is that this game has actually already been financed in the previous fund, it is already being developed and one of the proponents claims to have invested a lot of his own money in the project, that is, this is something that is already well underway, it is not leaving from scratch, which, in my opinion, increases the chances of the project being successful and that the impact that is being speculated to actually materialize. With that, I think there are several indications that the project will work, I think the ideas are promising (both in terms of being focused on an audience that can vary from children, which we agree, we know that it is quite profitable, and for a adult audience; and also for being easy to play), and I also think that the proposal is perfectly aligned with the objectives of the challenge. \n",

      "Starting with the fact that the proponents claim that they are working with the same studio that develops the game AdaQuest, one of the biggest and most famous of our blockchain. This already gives me some peace of mind, because it means that people who are well experienced in the field would be on board, and as the proponents themselves say, pitfalls could be avoided. Now moving on to an individual analysis of each part, starting with the script. We have a very clear roadmap of what will happen according to the quarters, we know which activities would be developed and in which order. This information is provided in a very illuminating way and we have already managed to have a very strong view of the process, but I think it could be even better if the activities were separated by month, instead of by quarter. It's good as it is, but it could be even better. Regarding the budget, the asking value is high but it makes sense with the complexity and size of the project, I think it is well divided and explained but some parts are better detailed than others. For example, we even know the hourly rate ($35/hr) of who would work on the game design, but it is not justified because the concept art would cost approximately 5k USD. This is a very high value to be directed only to a part of the project, as it happens in the marketing (which costs 10% of the budget alone) and legal parts. Such individual parts, which would already cost a good chunk of money, could be better explained, arguing the need for such an investment in each of them. And about the team, I think this part is perfect, knowing in detail who the team members are: their names, areas of activity, functions, a small resume and their linkedin profiles are also available where we can verify all the information said. about them. We also have a Cardano expert on the team (Conward), which makes sure we have someone very knowledgeable who will guide the rest of the participants on issues relevant to our ecosystem. So my only suggestions here are to improve the detailing of the dates in the script and also to better explain some parts of the budget. \n",

      "Proponents claim that measurement of progress would be done primarily by tracking activities against the timeline. As I mentioned in terms of feasibility, it would be even better if the division of activities was done on a monthly basis, because as it is, we do not know, for example, what is planned to be delivered at the end of the first and second month, only the third. However, we can already have a good idea of ​​what should be done with the information that is provided. I suggest that there is a bridge between the community and the game's development team, some members who had an affinity with the blockchain games universe could more closely monitor the development of activities, perhaps establishing monthly meetings with the team, from which summaries of partial progress could be generated, which could be forwarded directly to the rest of the community. Regarding the results, the main goal is to wedge 10k NFTs (Floofs) and to sell cosmetic products related to the game (as I understand it). The number of new wallets created would also be measured, because to take advantage of blockchain integration, players would need to create them. This to me would also be a direct indicator of how the players would be gradually getting to know and using the technologies of the Cardano ecosystem. That is, we have several variables to be measured to define the possible success of the game. I also think that a more comprehensive way of seeing this happening would be the proportion that the game would gradually acquire, I really believe that it has the potential to grow and become important, and as it expands, so would the knowledge about Cardano. Summarizing my opinion: the proposal is quite possible to audit, just a few things are improved to make it 100%. \n",

      "I thought this idea was really good, and I think it's quite necessary given the way NFT technology is becoming famous and changing the way people consume art, I totally agree with the proponents' assertion about many times the artistic value and everything that behind the NFTs being overshadowed by the economic issue. I think it is essential to promote an academic study on this topic, and I recognize several positive points in this proposal. The first of them is that the team that would form the event would be multidisciplinary, as the proponents claim, formed by experts from various areas, artists, developers of different blockchains, such as Cardano, Ethereum and others; where the challenge's objectives would be directly supported, there would be an exchange of knowledge between professionals belonging to our community and also to communities from other blokchains. And this fair challenge seeks just that, the integration between Cardano and other cryptographic ecosystems, in order to popularize our blockchain and make it more respected, improving its development with blockchains, so that project teams can help each other, exchange experienced, so that ideas that worked for other blockchains can be adapted to Cardano's characteristics and so on. All this would happen here in these events, only if the focus was on NFTs, the representatives of the blockchains would not fail to exchange experiences, as is sought in the challenge. Other positives are that we know exactly where this academic conference would be held (at the University of Oxford, called OxBAT: Oxford Blockchain, Art, Technology) and what topics would be covered in the 3-day event (NFTs, their artistic value and blockchains as a new medium for art; implications for the 'traditional' art market; NFT spaces on different blockchains; the influence of NFTs and blockchain technology on society). Some more details, such as how the target audience would be captivated to participate in the events, could also have been provided. However, I think the impact of the proposal will be maximum, I notice that many proposals that suggest holding events are very stuck in the theoretical part, but these proponents have already started the explanation giving us specifications and details on how everything would be put into practice. \n",

      "The proposal script is very good. The proponents explain what activities would be carried out each month, explaining in great detail and at a good length what would have to be done. I don't have criticisms about this, I usually suggest what they've already done, which is a monthly division of time and that each month it is very detailed which activities will have to be performed and how, and this is very well supported here. Talking about funding, a total of 8320 is requested, which in my opinion is a very fair value for the dimension, complexity and impact that this proposal will generate. The way this money would be used is very simple, the proponents will only allocate it for their time organizing the event (and explain that they will work once a week with it, detailing the amount of total hours dedicated to the project and also how much their work - 20 dollars, which I found to be a very affordable price compared to the amount asked by other professionals). I don't think we have such a complete view of how much specific parts would cost, such as marketing, space rent (if paid, as it would be at a university), if there would be slides to be produced (design costs graphic (e.g. diagramming and etc), if there would be a networking moment in which a snack would be served, if there would be other workers in these events responsible for the production itself (light, sound, cleaning, etc). I would have preferred that the proponents had given all this information in a more direct way than dividing the amount in half, with half for each as remuneration for the organization of the events. Organization encompasses many things, and we don't know how much each would cost individually. Finally, speaking of the proponents and the rest of the team (students), little information is provided about them. We only know their names and main academic/professional assignments. It would be better if they included a short script, so that we could get to know their previous work better and how they relate to Cardano, that is, if they have already developed projects within our ecosystem, if they are active members and so on. It would also be positive if they had attached their linkedin profiles. So I think the feasibility is ok, not bad, but some points (budget and team presentation) should have been more detailed. \n",

      "The proponents report really interesting ways to monitor the development of the project, which are the holding of weekly meetings and deadlines to be met. But enough detail was lacking here so that we could solidly understand how these two forms of auditing will come to fruition. First, speaking of weekly meetings, will the team address both the tasks that needed to be carried out in that time interval, in order to verify if they were, in fact, accomplished, and in the correct way? Will the partial results also be analyzed, that is, the verification of whether the small targets were achieved? And what would it be like for the Cardano community to stay abreast of what was discussed at these meetings? Will their results be made available in some way to our community members? Speaking of these deadlines, the proponents claim that they will participate in external financing processes and therefore will have deadlines to meet, which will be a reason why they will remain “in line”; it would be interesting for them to explain what other funding they are trying and what dates they intend to use to guide themselves. Regarding the final results, finally, they set very clear objectives to be met (strong concept covering and reflecting the diversity of the NFT space, speakers and guests from different blockchains and research fields, etc.). However, I think they lacked a little focus on our ecosystem. How will this project have positive consequences for Cardano, above the study of NFTs and the benefit of other blockchains? How can we measure if, indeed, new people have been added to our community, the number of CNFTs being minted and marketed has increased? Would new CAs, vCAs, proponents emerge from these events? People who invested in Cardano's technologies, in different ways? Nor is it very clear how all this knowledge will be taken to all members of our community. I think that a final report should be prepared, along with a short video presentation that summarizes both the process and the partial and final results of this project. This video could be made available on youtube, and the link sent to our discord and telegram channels, for example. How this information would be shared is at the discretion of the team, this was just a suggestion. Anyway, unfortunately I found this the most superficial part of the proposal, it's not bad, but it doesn't fully cover what we need to know in the safe monitoring of this proposal. \n",

      "When I see the proposals for this challenge, as well as the challenges focused on other geographic regions such as India, I realize that most of the proposals are aimed at translating basic content that explains Cardano to a more lay audience. This is undoubtedly important, but proposals that focus on a more technical audience from these geographic regions are rarer, as is what happens in this one. We are told that the project is about the translation of “an SSI SaaS platform without code (ProofSpace), including products and open documentation, from English to Swahili”. In this way, a technological tool that addresses the Cardano ecosystem will become accessible to this African audience, which will certainly open doors in terms of job opportunities. We know that the language barrier is the biggest impediment for Cardano to be disseminated in all regions of the world in a more democratic way. With this, when producing the translation of this content, we will be working exactly on this problem. The Swahili language is very important for the African people, having many speakers, I know this because I have already evaluated another proposal that also addressed the production of content for speakers of this language. Therefore, I think the proposal is advantageous and meets very well the objective of the challenge of spreading the Cardano ecosystem across Africa, thus increasing the general investment in our blockchain, either by facilitating the creation of Dapps, new members entering our community, purchasing and betrayal of Ada and so on. And, obviously, the other pillar of this proposal, which is the improvement of the African continent, would be fully achieved, since the aforementioned technological platform, if translated into the local language, would make it much easier for Africans to work with this tool, which would generate more employment opportunities and a more stable income. Besides of course, this type of service is very well paid, and one of the main objectives of our blockchain is to fight the social inequality present between continents, and we know that poverty rates in Africa are some of the highest in the world. For all these reasons, I agree that the proposal is in line with the challenge and that it will probably be a sure way to achieve what we aim for here. \n",

      "Regarding the roadmap, the main tasks to be completed in the total project development period are listed, and then these are divided according to the months. However, I think this explanation is still very superficial, for example in April and May two tasks are mentioned: receiving funds and recruiting a translator (preferably someone from the Catalyst community). In this case, would the entire month of April be used to receive funds? And in May, all that would be done would be the recruitment of the translator? How would they make this selection? How do they plan to get in touch with Swahili-speaking Africans who participate in our community? What criteria would be used to make the final choice? As in the example of the first two months, the activities of the following months could and should be more detailed, in order for us to have a deeper understanding of the project development process. Now, evaluating the other aspects of feasibility, in relation to the budget, this part gets a little confusing. The translator fee is 907 dollars, would that be paid in one lump sum, or would that be the monthly salary? How does this relate to the amount of USD 6300, which would be considered the full translation of the document? Several other parts related to translation are reported, however I believe that each of them should have been better explained. As described, the use of funding is still quite confusing for me and I cannot be sure if the amount requested is fair and compatible with the complexity and size of the project. And in relation to the team, finally, we have some information we need and some we don't. We know who those involved are, their names and what roles they previously played in their professional lives. However, it is not defined what each one would do in the project, nor do we have links to any of their social networks (linkedin profiles, for example), where we could see practical evidence of everything that was said. Also, it would be more interesting if they already had potential Swahili translators to present in the proposal description. Therefore, the feasibility is not bad, but there is also a lot to be improved so that full confidence is passed in the team, in the process and budget requested. \n",

      "According to the bidder, “all deliverables will be communicated openly to the Catalyst community through existing community channels such as the monthly reporting process.” How will this be done? What are the existing community channels? Will these deliveries take place at the end of each month? Several information about this sentence could have been provided to make the understanding of it more complete. I agree that this is the best way to promote a good follow-up of the process, as it is necessary for the Cardano community to follow from the budget release to the final delivery of the project. Therefore, it would be essential for the proponent to specify how this bridge would take place, whether it would be through online tools such as Notion, Google Docs, etc., or reports sent directly to community communication channels such as Telegram and Discord. One positive point I've identified here is that we're told it's expected to be delivered each month, so while we're not so clear on where these partial results would be made available, we know very well what to monitor. Regarding the final results, it can be summarized that they would be the “availability of an easy-to-use codeless SSI platform for the Swahili Cardano community” and the “consequential growth in the use of Atala PRISM”. We know what needs to be achieved, but as in the previous case regarding the process, how can the community verify that these goals have been achieved? It is necessary that the proposer and the rest of his team make such information necessary, that we know how to measure this progress, that they are summarized directly in infographics, for example, or through a video presentation with the sources of what is being It is spoken. Finally, that the community can have a simple and direct way to audit the final results and be sure of the veracity of the said information. So what I can suggest here as improvements would be, in general, to strengthen the bridge between the community and Cardano and the data on partial and final results.

      "The impact is the best part of this proposal. The idea is to hold 12 face-to-face events that explain what Cardano is to students at National Chengchi University in Taiwan. The author's justification is that in the country little is disseminated about our blockchain, people have little knowledge of it, in the same way that information and teachings are rare. So it makes a lot of sense that such events are promoted, as it will increase the knowledge of the local people about Cardano so that they can join our community in one way or another - or work on Catalyst as CAs, maybe buy Ada, CNFTs, study more about blockchain technologies (if they are in the technology area) and so on. In other words, the objectives of the challenge would be fully met, since our goal is precisely to focus on more particular communities, taking into account their cultural, linguistic and other characteristics. In fact, this proposal also makes a lot of sense for the challenge focused on Asia, since Taiwan is an Asian country, so it would be like a solution to two apparent “problems” (challenges). What left something to be desired, however, was the detail in relation to what would be done. For example, in these 12 meetings, which subjects would be addressed? I believe that information about Cardano would be laid out gradually, starting with more basic information such as what blockchain is, what cryptocurrencies are, how to create a digital wallet, and so on. Afterwards, more specific content would probably be addressed, which would be funneling (becoming more in-depth) as the meetings take place. This is the logic, however it would be important for the proponent to make it very clear which issues would be addressed. Other questions were also a little unclear in my perception, such as: would all the events be presented by the same Cardano expert, or different? If the same, who would it be? Would he or she travel monthly to Taiwan to give the workshop? In relation to students, how would they be captivated to participate in the event, considering that blockchain technology is still quite unknown there? Finally, there was a lack of detail in relation to how such meetings would be in practice. Therefore, I think the impact is certain, but for us to have even more security about it, more detailed explanations would be necessary about the practice of the proposed activities. \n",

      "Unfortunately, both this topic and auditability are well below quality impact. The script presented is quite superficial, we know what would happen in the intervals of 0-3 / 3-6 / 6-12 months, however, the activities presented are basically the same: the realization of an event, adding “x” number of students to each time period. Okay, we know this is the heart of the project, however, we need a lot more details to accurately understand the proposal development process. They agree that for the event to be possible, there would be a whole pre-production, a preparation, which would include things like defining the speaker, the exact location of the workshop within the university, how students would be captivated to participate in the meetings, definition of the topics covered , how the contents would be passed on, if there would be any coffee breaks, how interested students would be registered at the event, how we could follow their individual journey, if they actually decided to enter the Cardano community... In short, many factors that would need to be defined so that in fact we could not even understand not only what would be done, but also how? Another thing, the notion of time given by the proponent is quite extensive, first we are talking about quarters and suddenly a semester! Activities should be organized monthly, so the schedule created would be more appropriate. Now, starting with the budget analysis, approximately 10 thousand dollars are requested. This amount in my opinion is not abusive, as there would be 12 events, the whole process would take a year, so if we divide the amount by the number of events, it would be less than a thousand dollars invested per meeting. The problem is that the explanation of this amount is also very comprehensive, in my opinion. For example, $2,000 is ordered for logistics. What logistics would that be, exactly? What would be included here? $2500 is requested for coworking space, food and drinks. How much would go to coworking, and food and drinks? That 1200 dollars that would be Ada's donation - who would be receiving it? As with the roadmap, the budget detail would need to be greater, although compared to the budget roadmap it is even well explained. Finally, in terms of the team, it's actually just one person, which for me is a problem. How could someone alone manage to organize such a long project that involves so many activities? Not enough information about this person is provided either, we know that he is a student of that university, he was once a volunteer, he was also Miss Asia 2020 of Intelligence (what is that?). However, we don't know what he studies, what kind of connection he has with Cardano, because he would be prepared to promote this project. In this regard, unfortunately, confidence is not passed.

Discord, telegram? Only photos of the event are not enough for us, members of the Cardano community, to fully understand what happened. Starting with the fact that the pre-production process also needs to be audited, the proponent needs to provide us with information about how this whole project is developing little by little; that is, how can we monitor the activities that I mentioned in terms of feasibility (definition of the speaker, the exact location of the workshop within the university, how students would be captivated to participate in the meetings, definition of the topics covered, how the contents would be passed on, if there would be a coffee break, how would interested students be registered at the event, how could we follow their individual journey, if they actually decided to enter the Cardano community)? As well as a report on the event itself, the proponent should report how the activities that preceded it took place. This community update could be done through the chat he said he was going to create, we just need to know where that chat would be so that we could check at least monthly (it makes sense, as the events are monthly) what would be happening. Regarding the success, the final results, unfortunately the proponent does not provide us with any new information. He repeats every part of the script here, but that's not how we define success. In my opinion, the most direct and logical way of doing this is trying to understand what scenario we are trying to achieve, how the students involved in the workshops would be relating to Cardano, as I mentioned in the impact, what impact this would have on our community. That is, how could we measure the growth and popularization of our blockchain in Taiwan from this project? It is necessary for the author to define such information and also bring it to the Cardano community, it could be in the same chat that he will create, a final report could be made with all this information (it would be wonderful to include student testimonials). In this way, we would actually have knowledge of what happened after the project, how it changed the thinking of students at this university about blockchain and especially Cardano.

      "The idea is very good and serves the challenge’s objectives well, which are to promote projects that benefit both the African continent and Cardano’s blockchain. In the present case, online meetings would be developed between developers who speak French and come from Africa, this would certainly benefit the continent, as it would provide education for professionals in the field of technology, opening the door for them to work in one of the various opportunities. jobs present in the Cardano ecosystem (which can be found, for example, in Catalyst itself); this would give them more preparation for them to become future proponents, if they wish, build Dapps, in short, this will allow them to work with a company and a technology that is growing and popular, which will generate many opportunities for a stable income in the future. And for sure the project will also be great for our blockchain, for two basic reasons. First, because it will prepare new professionals to work on our projects, and manpower is something that is sometimes still lacking here, from what I understand, especially in specific tasks, such as programming in Plutus, for example. And, in addition to generating a skilled workforce, this series of classes (so to speak) would popularize the Cardano ecosystem for a community that, as the proponents themselves say, is often excluded, French speakers in Africa. It is very positive as the proponents already have a defined destination for where they will start this project - Congo - this gives us a more solid view of what is to come. It is also positive that they will record the meetings and post them on youtube, because the internet connection can often be a problem for those involved here, so that would not be an impediment for them to participate in the project. Another positive point is that they already have a base, a telegram community with more than 130 developers, if everyone fits the characteristics highlighted here, that is, whether they are Africans and French speakers, there is already a very considerable amount of people to participate. from the project. However, I think some important details were left out, such as: what content would be covered in these meetings, in what order, with what strategy they would be passed on, what amount of meetings are expected, what amount of developers is expected for each meeting, if after the conclusion of these meetings there would be some way to follow the development of the professionals involved... Finally, details, which, if provided, would certainly add even more value to the impact of this idea. \n",

      "The feasibility of the project is ok, but it can improve in some aspects. Let's start with the script, there are some tasks that would need to be fulfilled, such as “reconstitution of the English classes in French in pdf, powerpoint” and “creation of a small promotional video for the invitation to participate”. We also know what general issues would be addressed in each month of the project. However, the script could have been better organized. The activities that would take place monthly could be divided, and each one of them is very detailed. For example, in the first month, the focus would be to take these classes in pdf/powerpoint, right? How long would it take to prepare each class? Who would work on it? What is the approximate size of these classes? As the proponents explain to us the areas to be studied each month, the theme of each class should also be defined individually. For example, in “June 2022: Introduction to Cardano, Blockchain and Smart Contracts”. This topic is quite extensive, how many meetings would take place this month? And what specific topic of each, within this universe of introduction to Cardano and etc? In other words, the script is still a bit messy, in my opinion, because we know what would happen, but not when, how or who would carry out each activity. Regarding the budget, I believe the asking amount of 9k USD is very fair, and would be money very well invested. However, I would like it to be better explained, its explanation is quite superficial. 3k would go for content creation in French and creation of a promotional video, would the content be the classes in pdf/powerpoint? How many would be created, to understand their individual value? Who would receive this money? The rest would go to video editing and pay the trainers. How much would go to editing, and how much to the coaches' salary? How many hours would these coaches work, what would be the value of their working hour? And in relation to the team, I think this part is very good, they are apparently very qualified people and very involved with Cardano, in addition to a small CV of each, the proponents attach their linkedin profiles, of how we can have concrete proof about what is said. However, I think it would be even more interesting if the roles of each of these members in the project were defined, we don't know who would do what. But that's all that remains pending, otherwise, I think this part of the proposal is very good. Therefore, my suggestions for feasibility here are: improving the script, establishing greater detail and a more detailed time division; explain better how the money would be used and define the tasks of each team professional in the project. \n",

      "Auditability here is above average. Proponents are concerned with outlining ways to monitor both the project development process and the final results. I think some improvements can be made, but let's go in parts. Regarding the monitoring of the project, this could happen by checking the videos posted on youtube, which would correspond to the weekly meetings; from what I understand these moments (or the contents taught?) would also be available in text form on another site. This already gives us good content to be audited, we have material to analyze in relation to the progress of the project. It would be even better, though, if the team's professionals could provide some input regarding how the developers who are participating in the meetings are responding to the events; how many are going to each session; if there is a good interaction during this synchronous moment; if they are having difficulty learning about a topic; in short: to understand how these meetings are going, not only if they are happening. I think that, since they have already opened a communication channel through the website https://uptodatedevelopers.com/our-trainings, a small analysis of each meeting could be posted there, I don't think that video meetings are necessary, for example, if that platform is already being used. Perhaps the follow-up and engagement questionnaire, cited in the key indicators, is exactly what I am suggesting; in this case, I consider that the auditability of the process is perfect. And speaking of the final results, the proponents choose good indicators to see if the project would be having the intended impacts, such as the number of participants per session; whether they would come out prepared to develop a Dapp, for example; whether the Congolese developers would be effectively using this “gateway” that is being offered to them and so on. I only had one question: how would the project team collect and disseminate such information? Would it be through the same website as the project's progress? I would like to understand this, in order to have complete confidence in the question of whether the final results will be well audited. I think the best way is to contact the developers directly and apply a quick questionnaire, asking things like if they are participating in a project at Cardano and so on. So I think the auditability here is almost perfect, with few things to improve. \n",

      "I found this proposal really perfect when it comes to impact. The idea is to create a series of videos that teach the Haskell programming language to Vietnamese. The justification for such a project is necessary and that this type of content is lacking for the natives of Vietnam, and really, this type of learning is usually only available in English, and for those who do not have this as their mother tongue it becomes doubly complicated. of learning. There is also the fact that Haskell is not such an accessible language for people who know how to program in other languages, this makes it even more important that this course is created. I found it very positive how the proponent explains exactly the topics covered in the course (Type Haskell, Syntax in, Functions, recursion, Higher-order functions, modules, Making our own types and type classes, Input and output, Solving problems functionally, monoids and Monads). This gives us complete clarity about the content of each video created. It is also great to know that the course was based on a book recommended by the IOHK itself, this conveys a lot of confidence in relation to the validity of the theory studied. The project fits the objectives of the challenge as it will definitely help to popularize Cardano for a specific group of people (programming students from Vietnam), respecting their specificities (such as the spoken language). In addition to everything I have already said, it is also very relevant how the proponent intends to make a question and answer session to help even more students in possible difficulties that they may face only in asynchronous moments. Therefore, I think this proposal will have maximum impact. \n",

      "Regarding the script, this part is great, we know exactly what will be produced in each month of the project, I really have no criticisms to make on this part since the proponent detailed how many videos will be created and what their themes are. Speaking of the budget, I believe that it is very simple to understand the amount requested because it corresponds to the value of the time used to produce the videos and also the exercises. In my opinion, the amount charged for the hour of work is a little expensive, compared to other proposals for similar activities, however it is at the discretion of other readers, CAs and voters to form their opinion whether the price charged is adequate or not. Now speaking in relation to the team, more information is provided about some members (Mrs Hannah for example) than others (Mr Curtis D'Alves for example). Ideally, the same level of detail would be available on both. However, analyzing the trust that is passed on to the team, I think they seem to be well qualified people, we have an experienced haskell programmer, a translator for Vietnam and a very active woman in the Cardano community, I mean, we have all the necessary functions so that this team is complete and well qualified for the respective tasks of the project. In short, I think the feasibility is very good, just needing a little more details about the first two team members and, in my opinion, the hourly rate charged is a little high, but as I said, this It could just be my view and I could be wrong. I think the team has generally provided us with the information we need to be confident in the feasibility of the project. \n",

      "I think the partial results of this project are very simple to evaluate, because we can see the videos posted on youtube and the exercises uploaded on github. These are clear ways of auditing deliveries, little by little. I think it would also be interesting to have information about the tasks of the professionals, necessary for these small goals to be achieved. If there were some way to audit the pre-production of the generated materials, the auditability of the progress would go up. And finally, speaking of the final deliverables and how it would be possible for us to audit them, the proponent explains to us quite extensively several ways that success would be viewed, such as “Plutus Pioneer Program participants will also get the basics of Haskell to learn from most effectively” and “after 6 months, we will help at least 50 people join the Plutus Pioneer Program course and 10 proposals submitted on Catalyst through the Haskell Course For Beginner”. These are both qualitative and quantitative data, provided that these nominees are duly presented in the monthly meetings with the challenge teams. So I think auditability is almost perfect, just add some way to audit the tasks in the first part of the monitoring analysis. \n",

      "As the title suggests, this project aims to create a platform that “brings together individuals who wish to invest in startups, to entrepreneurs who develop products and services with the potential for growth at scale”. This is not entirely in line with the objectives of the challenge, although it is something that is quite interesting. In the present challenge, from my understanding, we want to fund projects, applications that are beneficial both for Cardano and for some developing community. This includes helping a certain population in the community, whether in the areas of health, education, employment, etc., through of course technologies present in our blockchain, so that both parties benefit: there is social impact and also an expansion of Cardano. In the case of the present proposal, I think that only the second part, that is, improvement of our blockchain, is being targeted. It is not stated in the proposal at any time that this project has any social role, it wants to generate an impact on communities in need from developing countries/localities. I think that if this platform had some kind of investment in the humanitarian sector, then yes, it would be fully aligned with the objectives of this challenge, but the way the project was structured I think it would better fit the Dapps challenge. It is certainly a project that can help the Cardano ecosystem, in this part I have no doubts, as it would connect possible investors, people interested in undertaking and participating in projects, generating products and services that are used within our blockchain, all this would certainly increase investments in Ada, number of digital wallets, transactions on our blockchain and it would be a good way to publicize it (by establishing these new relationships). Therefore, I think it is still a high-value proposition, which could be modified and improved to fully align with the specific objectives of the Nation Building Dapps challenge. \n",

      "The script part is very good, a monthly schedule of activities is established, where the tasks to be done each month are listed, so that we have a full understanding of the process. I often see in the proposals an explanation of what would be done but not when, and this does not happen here, in this case we also have a temporal notion, which helps us to understand the process as a whole as well as it will help with auditability, as I will comment on analysis topic below. It would be even more interesting if the team determined how long on average each of these activities would take to be developed, but this is just a suggestion for improvement. The level of detail provided on this part of the proposal is already quite satisfactory. Regarding the budget, this part is ok, it is possible to understand how the requested money would be used, the proponent states that more details on this would be provided in case the proposal is actually funded, but I think that as much detail as possible should already have been attached to the proposal. For example, we know the journalist's salary (1200 dollars), but it is not justified why he would receive this amount. I would like to know more about his work routine, how many days a week he would work, for how many hours a day, etc. And about the team, we know who those involved are, having the following information: their names, roles in the project, a small resume of work developed so far (and a way to prove this, such as their linkedin profiles) in addition to something fundamental : how these people relate to the Cardano ecosystem. As an active member, we only have Otávio Lima, I think having a person who is very involved with our blockchain is the minimum that proposals should present (ideally with all participants being active members). In any case, through Otávio's participation, we can guarantee that there is someone qualified to handle the technologies in our ecosystem. The auditability part is almost perfect, with a few more details, as I mentioned, I would give it full marks. \n",

      "The auditability of the project in my opinion is good, but it is not ideal either. We can monitor whether the development process was done properly through the rich detail in the roadmap. It is possible to verify that the tasks that were promised for each month were actually being done at the right time and in the right way. For this, it would be necessary for: either the team itself to gather this data and make it available in a simple and fast way to the Cardano community, or that some members interested in the project could, in a private way, meet with the team at the end of each month to verify the what has been done so far, the gradual results of the project. Regarding the results, I think they indicate the clearest ways to see if the project was successful, which would be the number of investors on its platform, the number of contracts generated, etc., that is, a lot of numerical data. But I believe that we must go further, also making a qualitative analysis of the impact of this project on Cardano, I think that this can be done through the individual follow-up of some projects that were born through the networking generated on this platform. How would they be developing, if they achieved their goals, if they helped to expand Cardano's technologies and took them to people's practical lives, etc. This information should, in my view, be synthesized and forwarded to the proposal team, the leaders of the projects that were born there would contact the leaders of the present project, some of this feedback could be added and with that presented to the Cardano community. That way, we would have a better view of the results of the efforts presented here. In summary, I found a good proposal, auditable, that needs some improvements. \n",

      "I think this proposal fits more or less with the objectives of the challenge. The idea is to launch a platform called Decentralized Metaverse Mall (DMM), which will use “blockchain, metaverse, Web3 and the very Web 2.0 of partners such as online merchants, payment gateway, auction house to create the first Consume to Earn (C2E) model. )”. The goal is for the Vietnamese to start using more cryptocurrencies, according to a survey cited by the proponents (it is very positive how they attach the link to it, proving its existence), few natives of the country actually use technologies from the cryptographic world; however, there is great interest in accepting cryptocurrencies, with people claiming that they would use them as an investment or even to make purchases of products and services, currently. Therefore, the proponents intend to take advantage of this gap to create a platform that captivates people to use cryptocurrencies, more specifically Ada and a so-called C2E, which would be created in this ecosystem, which for me is a problem; why not just Ada? We don't know how many % would be accepted from Ada and how many % from C2E, so we have no way of predicting how our blockchain will benefit from this. Maybe they use their own currency and have included Ada so that it was justifiable for the project to be released on Catalyst, anyway, that worries me. Returning to analyze the platform that would be created here, the proponents claim that people would be rewarded when they carry out transactions with partner merchants (a way to encourage the target audience to use this application). Another point that concerns me here is that the proponents do not explain whether other technologies pertinent to Cardano would be used here, or just our cryptocurrency. Would smart contracts be coined? Would users of this platform be somehow encouraged to use other Dapps? Would the Ada that could be received as cash back be invested in some pool? Anyway, I found the idea very interesting, its target audience is certainly promising, one for the key to be invested by our blockchain (including I already have several proposals that talk about Vietnam, so I'm sure about that), but I don't think it stays explicit if Cardano would benefit so much and not as during this project. \n",

      "The proposal script is very basic, that is, we do know what would need to happen for the project to be developed; however, all in a relatively superficial way. The whole process is divided into 3 phases, and for each of them, we know the most important tasks. What I think could be modified, in order to improve, is the temporal division. For example, in the first phase we have several tasks, we know that together they would amount to a time of 2 months; but how long would each of these design-related actions take to materialize? Could some of them happen in parallel, or one at a time? I think if the proponents had been more specific about this time division issue, our understanding of the whole would be solid. Phase 2, for example, would take 4 months, and 3 tasks are explained (building the website, the Dapp (for mobile devices) and the DMM platform, along with the integration of APIs from partners). Because these activities are complex, I think it would be necessary to go into more detail about each one. For example, building the website encompasses several small actions. Who would make them, in what way, and through what work routines? Regarding the explanation of the financing, I found this part better, the proponents explain how the total amount requested would be distributed, and each part has a parentheses that better details what would be done there. As in infrastructure and data design, we know that it would consist of: “server system, network, security, cloud services, customer data, 360 customer profiles, etc”. We also know the hourly price of the professionals involved in each of the parties, that is, the understanding of how the requested money would be spent is very specific and adequate. Finally, analyzing the team involved, this part is also very good. We know the names of the professionals involved, their roles in this project, a very well explained curriculum containing previous experiences and how they relate to Cardano (and if they do), social network profiles where we can verify what is said... part of the proposal is impeccable and exemplary, as it is explained in great detail who each person who makes up the team is, conveying total confidence in the team. Therefore, the only suggestion I make is for the script to be more specific in terms of time. \n",

      "Auditability is excellent when it comes to process. Proponents define several specific KPIs for each phase of the project, and say that partial results will be made available on a website. It would be interesting to know how long these updates would be released or if they would only be at the end of each phase (in this case, I consider it a very long time, making it inappropriate. I would like at least monthly reports to be shared with the Cardano community, even that do not say about all the aforementioned KPIs). It would also be interesting if we had knowledge about how the tasks were performed, in addition to their results (goals and tasks are different things: they are tasks that generate the goals, they are behind them). I would like to know if this issue would also be addressed in these updates made to the site. In any case, the auditability suggested for monitoring the development is very good, it is very specific and conveys a lot of confidence as to how this project will be monitored over time. It is critical that a bridge be clearly established between the team and the Cardano community, as the proponents do early on. Regarding the auditability of the final results, I don't think the suggested analyzes are that good, because they only talk about the space that would be developed (\"an MVP version called Decentralized Metaverse Mall (DApp)\"), and numerical metrics that would point how many users would be using the platform, how many transactions were carried out in relation to a certain period of time and so on. I think they are safe ways to see if success has been achieved for the platform created, but they are not direct ways to see what the consequences of all this were for Cardano. Are these users using more Ada or C2E? Did they somehow become active members of the Cardano ecosystem? Would they be investing the Ada received in cashback in pools? Would they be using other Dapps besides this one? In other words, has this project contributed to the expansion and greater adoption of our blockchain technologies? It would be necessary for the proponents to collect this information and carry out an analysis of the case, in addition to being quantitative, qualitative. And for all the data to be made available to our community, it could even be through the website they cite in the progress monitoring part. Finally, I think auditability is very good for progress, but unfortunately it drops a lot on the final success part, as it focuses solely on Dapp, not the Cardano ecosystem as a whole. \n",

      "This proposal relates well to the general goals of our Cardano blockchain. Cardano aims to promote not only a technological leap, but also to establish positive impacts in several areas for the planet, such as the environment. In this sense, the game intends to work with the protection of clean water, which would be very much in line with this principle of our blockchain. As we are told, in addition to water protection, the game would also aim to protect species and plants and animals, thus intensifying its environmental value. I believe that the proposal also aligns with the specific objectives of the challenge, which are, in general, to create games that can be engaging and make use of Cardano ecosystem technologies, in order to popularize our blockchain. It is said that players would possess a “piece of nature” in the form of NFT (which logically would be coined in Cardano, thus achieving the specific objectives of the challenge). We also know that some data, such as water purity, would be measured live and networked, so that everyone could have access to such information (and in a non-corruptible way too), which once again meets what the challenge seeks. The main objective of the game, as I understand it, would be survival, through escaping from traps and hunting for supplies. Through these tokens, you would own a piece of nature, benefiting it, and you would also learn more about the ecosystem as a whole: what happens and why. It's a good idea. But one thing that came to my mind about the impact here is why the currency in circulation in the game couldn't be Ada instead of Omimimo. Our blockchain is expanding, and in my view it is important to measure efforts to increase the adoption and circulation of our own currency, rather than creating or financing the use of new types of crypto. The part of the team organizing a physical camp, where players could move around and have the real experience of all this seemed a little disconnected from the rest of the proposal. Where would that be, exactly? The players would cover all the costs of this trip, right? And where would the money go? What activities would be developed in this camp? What would be the impact of this part of the project for Cardano? This part seems to have been included to add value to the proposal (another interesting thing), but it needs a better detail so that we can understand how this would happen and with what objectives. In the proposal, we see this topic addressed in the following excerpt: “Q3-22 real-life visits to Nordic Wild camp. As a holder, you will be able to visit the water it owns, see the real world heritage and spend some time in real nature...”. However, it is a very short explanation and it was not enough to understand exactly how this part of the project would take place. \n",

I found it very positive that in the first stage, the creation of visual material would be carried out so that the public understands how the game works, in my view this is a great strategy to draw attention and encourage people to play. It would be interesting to understand a little more about this part: where would these materials be released? I would like to see how that would turn out. Furthermore, the phases are divided into blocks of time, where each one of these divisions is composed by the listing in topics of which tasks would be developed. I feel like we can get a solid view of what will happen from the data provided. Another note regarding this division of phases: in phase Q3 22, the team claims that it will be possible to visit the physical camp. Again I touch on this point: where will this be, exactly? We know it's Nordic, but in which city, will this be accessible to the wider audience or is it something more geared towards those who live nearby? Finally, about these phases: they are the best part of the feasibility topic because they allow us to understand exactly what would happen and in what order and what the team's ambitions are for this project. However, when it comes to staff and funding, unfortunately, the same richness of detail is not found. For example, in the explanation of the requested money. The team claims that 12k is required for coding the game, I agree that this work is complex and requires a high investment, the problem is that it is not detailed how this work would be done. It's five weeks into this development, we don't know exactly what would happen in the first, second and so on. It is important to understand who would be doing this, what their work routine is and the small tasks that would result from the whole, the coding of the game. The same is found in the other parts of the budget, the conceptual design for example. How would it be developed? Why would that last 3 weeks? And finally, about the team, I think the proposal lacked detail about who is who, what they do, their resumes, etc. For example, Maria is the creator of the game and advocates for greater inclusion of women in Cardano. But what role would she play here, exactly? What do we know about her curriculum, projects developed previously? We have the “K”, who would provide technical support and be a consultant. First, what is this person's name? What is your professional training? How does he or she relate to Cardano? What kind of consultancy would he/she provide? How can we get proof of your CV? It would be necessary for team members to include more information about themselves, their full names, linkedin profiles (if any), their detailed roles in this project, etc. In this way, more confidence in the team's ability to successfully carry out the project would be conveyed. \n",

      "The team provide us with good data that serve as ways to audit the proposal. Starting with the fact that, in the previous topic, we have divided project phases, with respective tasks about what would happen in each stage. In this way, we are given information about what would happen and when, so it is very possible to monitor whether the activities that were promised were actually being carried out, at the appropriate time and in the right way. And in relation to the final results themselves, here the metrics of success in the short, medium and long term are established. I think it's very positive how the team believes in the project (it has to be that way), setting horizons of success for a very long period, for example, beyond two years, when the game would theoretically be self-sustainable. The objectives are divided with the notion of time according to the months, in which several goals to be achieved are listed, allowing the community to monitor whether what was intended was achieved. For a very complex and expensive project, there needs to be a very accurate and close monitoring, this could be done from a team of professionals who understand both games and our blockchain and its technologies. Ideally, these people could establish direct and periodic contact with those who develop the project, in order to trace an accurate follow-up that can be shared with the rest of the community. It would also be interesting if some representatives of the game were present at Town Hall and presented progressive results, as is already the case with some projects. In general, in my opinion, everything is in line here, the team establishes very well what we need to monitor and what specific goals to achieve (which also includes the wide adoption of Cardano and popularization of the blockchain, fully meeting what is requested in the challenge). \n",

      "This proposal fully fits the objectives of the challenge, because here we are looking for ways to benefit Cardano and India in parallel. This will certainly happen with this project, since the activities of the Mediators.ai platform (previously called Win Win) would be expanded to the country. This platform promotes the conciliation of conflicts outside the judicial system, aiming to avoid unnecessary expenses and bureaucracy. In this way, Indians would be directly benefited. Both because they can submit their problem situations on the platform, in order to try to solve them with more transparency, using the benefits supported by our Cardano ecosystem. This could be done if expensive and unnecessary fees were avoided, for example, and being able to have all the information about the action minted on the blockchain and with that they would be immutable and more secure; and for those Indians who decide to be mediators, who prepare and qualify for it, as this is certainly a good opportunity for extra income for those who have the profile of the vacancy and are properly educated. This project will also be beneficial for Cardano since our technologies would be adopted in a new activity in that country. This can bring many benefits, such as increasing trust in blockchain technology; also, the demystification of some prejudices such as “blockchain is just investing in cryptocurrencies, that is, a risky way to get rich quickly); in terms of popularization. Once people get to know one of the uses of blockchain, they can become more interested in the subject, researching and learning other ways to become active members of our community. It is positive that this proposal is an extension of a project that is already underway and is already taking place in the United States - the expansion to India means studying the market, understanding its specificities and adapting the instances of the Mediators.ai platform according to the results of this research. And this will probably happen successfully, because of all the experience that the team already has in this same project. So I think the impact will be very positive, both for India and Cardano.

      "The feasibility of the project is great because the proponents provide us with all the information we need to know what would happen, when, how, for how much money and who would be involved in it. But let's go by parts. Regarding the script, the months in which the project would be developing are informed: September, October and November. We know exactly what activities were going to take place in each of these periods, so we have a great understanding of the process to come. So the script part is fine. Now moving to the budget, the requested money would be divided into 3 parts: the salary of the mediator, the salary of one of the members of the Mediators.ai platform and also the value of the platform located in India. Regarding this part, I think there could be a little more detail, for example: how many hours the professionals involved would work; what constitutes this expense of the platform located in India (would it be some kind of tax? This is not so clear to me). So I think it is possible for us to understand how the requested money would be used, but it would be even better understood if these details were provided. Finally, analyzing the team, I think this is the most trusting part of the whole proposal, since a) all members inform their names, describe in an extensive way what they have done so far in their professional careers, being very active people in the Cardano ecosystem, who have already delivered other initiatives outside this platform 2) they are part of the company team (Loxe Inc.) that works with Cardano's blockchain, this demonstrates how experienced they are with the technologies that relate to it of our ecosystem c) in addition, as I mentioned in the impact part, this proposal is about the evolution of something that already exists. This project is already a reality, they already make the activities of the platform happen in the United States d) they are also expanding the platform to Latin America, which demonstrates how, in addition to having a lot of technique, they also already have some experience in how to make that the initiative adapts to new contexts. Therefore, the feasibility is very good, there is a lot of security in the whole, and my only suggestion is the increase in the hours spent by professionals on this project, in the budget part. \n",

      "Finally, we will analyze the auditability of this proposal. We know that on progress, the proposers will organize themselves internally through a methodology chosen by them (it would be interesting to explain more about this, as I believe that most readers of the proposal do not know which methodology exactly this is). Regarding how the partial results would come to the knowledge of the Cardano community, they say that reports will be made, which will likely contain updates on how the monthly activities were performed as well as what goals were achieved in that period of time. These reports will be shared in monthly meetings with IOG project coordinators. In this way, a lot of security is passed on how the project will be monitored as it progresses. Now, speaking of the final results, the proponents point out what are the expected results for a period of 3, 6 and 12 months after funding. This generates a very good understanding of what success would be, we know how many mediators they intend to be working at Japan's Mediators.ai. It would also be interesting for the proponents to do a survey on how this project impacted the Japanese public, have people in that country shown themselves to be open to adopting this alternative form of conflict resolution? Did this also help to demystify what blockchain is over there? Was it an important factor in the widespread adoption of Cardano in that country? Finally, a more qualitative analysis would also be interesting, in order to understand the consequences of this proposal for both Japan and Cardano. \n",

      "I thought this proposal was very good and necessary. The team intends to create short 2-minute videos and podcasts in Vietnamese, summarizing content from 25% of the proposals from each funding fund (in this case, Funds 9 and 10). This is necessary for two reasons: first, the fact that the contents on ideascale are all in English, which in fact makes it difficult for non-speakers of that language to understand them, and secondly, because there are many proposals (the number of proposals has been growing exponentially with each background), and thus it is difficult to have time to read everything and follow what is happening in the background. I agree with these thoughts, and I think that this can be quite beneficial, and it can correspond to some objectives of the challenge, although from my research Vietnam is not located exactly in the geographic region that the fund focuses on, but rather close. In this way, local residents and those around them would benefit greatly, the Catalyst process would certainly receive a very beneficial boost, local CAs would be better able to evaluate, voters would better understand part of the evaluations and thus be more aware at the time of vote. In general, it would achieve the goals of the challenge, democratizing access to Cardano for this specific audience, from beginners to the most experienced in blockchain, since such content would be made accessible. It would be very incredible if this same idea were taken to other languages, that is, to create short audiovisual content that summarizes/explains some proposals from the financing funds, in Portuguese, Spanish, Italian and etc (I saw that they also have this proposal to translate for Japanese)... The only question that came to my mind was: how would that 25% be selected? With the plethora of proposals in each Catalyst round, how would the team select the ones most needed, say, to be translated and synthesized? Other than that, I loved this project, I think it deserves top marks. \n",

      "In the proposal, we have a good detail of how the development of the project would be: what would happen in the respective funds, and all this is divided into small tasks, which are explained in a succinct but sufficient way so that we can have a good view of the context. The only thing I missed was timing accuracy, i.e. how long would each of these tasks take to happen? What months of the year would they be in? We can have an idea on account of which background they would take place in, but this information could be located even better in time. It would also be interesting to better explain who would do each thing, for example, “filtering proposals in Fund 10 using the 2Min Criteria”; the point I made in the impact topic: what criteria are these? How would these proposals be selected, who would do this? “Review articles to select the top 600 analytical articles” - who would do the review? Regarding the budget division, this part is quite detailed, leaving nothing to be desired; we know what it would cost how much and in relation to the hours of work, in addition to their value, how many would be needed to complete the tasks. There is really nothing to criticize about this part. Finally, the team involved in the project conveys a lot of confidence. They explain who they are, individually, their names, functions, a little of what they have done so far, and also provide links to their personal pages, where we can get to know them more intimately. I think the members' introduction was perfect, for me this is the best way to explain who those involved are. Also, as I understand it, they have also been financed previously. Therefore, I will give it full marks, because they care to provide a lot of information and in a very detailed way (my only suggestion is really to improve the temporal notion in the script). \n",

      "It is very positive as the team points out 3 auditability indicators; this demonstrates that they are already concerned with establishing ways in which we can monitor the project, information that is very practical and applicable to the day-to-day execution of this proposal. As it is also a project that boils down to creating media, it is possible for the community itself to accompany it by directly verifying the podcasts and videos created. The indicators are, in my opinion, a good way to understand how the public is dealing with the project, but it is possible to go further, to monitor whether what was promised is being fulfilled: if the summaries are being released properly and at the expected frequency. It would be necessary for some Vietnamese-speaking member of the Cardano community to follow the project and bring this feedback to the rest of the community through one of our various communication channels. They also set goals, thus providing more means by which we can verify that goals have been achieved. In summary: here there are very plausible ways of tracking both the process (based on the tasks that are cited in the previous topic) and the results (through the indicators provided in this topic). \n",

      "This proposal is extremely necessary and can be very useful for society and also beneficial to expand the Cardano ecosystem. The idea is to create a “one dapp for homeowners to register their properties/properties for housing programs. These programs may include long-established voucher-based housing programs, time-sensitive temporary housing (to serve people displaced due to natural disasters, refugees due to war, etc.), or the common rental market.” That is, a platform that will help people who are experiencing some type of vulnerability to register their homes, while using technologies relevant to the Cardano ecosystem, as the data will be recorded on the blockchain. I believe it is an idea that aligns very well with the proposal, since it will have a very strong humanitarian impact, and this challenge from what I understand is to help promote Dapps that are beneficial for Cardano but also help people from developing nations or those that are experiencing a problem (in this case, whether social, if they are trying to link to affordable housing programs, or environmental, in case they have been affected by natural disasters). Several points are positive here: some bidders already have previous experience with the property registration issue; the project will be developed by the team of the company Loxe Inc., which is extremely skilled in the technical aspect, has already won other financing and they already have projects being executed (such as the Win Win platform) with our blockchain; another positive point is that they have a lot of networking, connections and important partnerships that are certainly a differential to increase the quality level and the future success of the proposal; etc. In other words, I think the proposal makes a lot of sense with the challenge it was submitted to and has a high chance of having a truly positive impact. \n",

      "The feasibility of the proposal is very good, starting with the script, which activities would be carried out over the months are explained. In this way, it is punctuated in a very exact way how the project development process would be, making it simple for us to understand the steps that would need to be taken. In relation to the budget, the amount requested is high, however it is well explained, it is basically the salaries of the professionals involved. There are a lot of people who would be working on this project, so it's justified because the requested amount is needed. My suggestion for making this part of the proposal even clearer is: it could be better explained how the work routines of those involved would be. Would everyone dedicate themselves full-time, or just part-time, to the project? Would some spend more time working on it than others? I think that if we knew how many hours each one would dedicate to the realization of this Dapp, we would have a more solid understanding of how the money would be used, since we would know the price per hour of work of those involved. Now, speaking of the team, this is the best part of feasibility. We know a lot of information about everyone involved: their names, academic backgrounds, areas of professional activity, so they relate to the Cardano ecosystem (we have experts in Plutus and people who have developed important tools for our community, such as CA and vCA tool, for example). There is a lot of confidence in the team and in its ability to carry out the project successfully. Therefore, I believe that my only suggestion is to add the working hours information from the budget part, this would be an addition to improve what is already good. \n",

      "It is possible to follow the project development process based on the steps provided by the roadmap, but it would be interesting for the team involved to make their weekly analyzes (or part of them available to the Cardano community). With this, it would be possible to understand if the small objectives of the smaller time periods were reached, if the established KPIs and goals were being achieved. However, it is not very clear, in my opinion, if this weekly analysis would really be shared, how the Cardano community could have access to this information, how we could safely understand if the tasks were being accomplished at the right time and in the right way. So in my view, even though the team has provided information about the feasibility of the project, it is not so clear how it would reach all of us, requiring a review of this part of the proposal. Regarding the final results, the main objective is to help solve the housing crisis, as the proponents say, and this can be seen by the number of houses registered in Dapp (the goal is 100 properties in 3 months). I believe that as properties are registered, this social benefit will occur as well as the popularization of Cardano, after all, more people will be getting involved with the technologies of our ecosystem, knowing them and understanding their advantages. So my opinion is that the process of auditing the progress could be better detailed and clearer, but the final results part is more tangible and simpler for the community to follow. \n",

      "The idea is very simple and super interesting, meeting the objectives of the challenge very well. It is about evolving a project that already exists, which is based on the following situation: our wallet addresses are very large and complicated, people are insecure about making transactions on the blockchain because they are not sure if any characters are wrong, so usually they do a test sending 1 ADA just to check if everything is ok even with the address created. This is quite problematic because, as the proponents report, it ends up causing people to spend twice as much on transaction fees. It is much better in fact if our addresses were shorter and simpler, this would convey much more security when receiving or sending our cryptocurrency. The idea of ​​this proposal is to create a list of contacts, that is, addresses, that are saved so that we can transfer or receive Ada more quickly and safely from frequent contacts. Let's imagine that a company decides to adopt payment in Ada and asks its employees to create wallets. Even if the group of employees is not that large, for example, it could be 5 employees, the boss would probably do the test transfer to verify that their wallet addresses are correct. This is problematic on two points: the first, which has already been explained by the proponents, in which the employer would pay double the fees (which gets worse if we are talking about executing the payment of 5 employees, as there would be a total of 10 fees paid) ; and the second problem would be the work it would take to get the addresses of each employee, this would take some time since each one has its own very extensive code. 582 / 5.000\n",

      "If this payment is made monthly, for example, if the boss already has a list of his permanent employees in his portfolio, he can select the payment in a much more practical way. That is, the evolution of this application really aligns with what we are looking for in the challenge, as the proponents themselves claim, the proposal would meet the following commands: “what needs do Cardano users have that can be solved by new applications?” + “which apps offer the most value with the least technical sophistication?” + “Integrations with existing products”. \n",

      "Regarding the script, I thought that the proponents could have been a little more specific about the activities that would be developed in the months in question, August, September and October. They tell us the main tasks for each month, but it would be even better if they had detailed each one more. For example, we know that in August we will be working on the “Address Book UX Design”. How will this be done? How will the designer propose this interface, what would his work routine be like so that this goal is delivered at the end of the month? My opinion is that the schedule is not bad, but also has a more basic character. Now talking about the use of funding, the amount requested for the project is 10 thousand dollars, the proponents explain that this funding would be used for the salary of the professionals involved. It would be $1,000 for the designer, $1,000 for the project manager, and $8,000 for the software engineer. I believe that, as with the script, a little more detail could have been delivered here. How many hours a day do these professionals intend to work? For how many days a week? Since the engineer will work part-time, would it be 4 hours a day of work, taking into account that a daily is usually 8 hours? I believe it is possible to understand the reason for this amount, and I really think it is fair for the proportion of the project and the benefits it will generate for the Cardano community, however I would be more pleased if these more details were provided. And finally, speaking of the team, in my view this part is perfect, we know the names, the professional roles and some past experiences of each member of this team. They are very experienced in their areas of expertise, having already delivered several projects and tools, and are very active in our community as well. Trust is also passed on because they are already developing this project, this proposal would be an evolution of the product. So, about the team, I really have no criticism to make as I think that part is already ideal. In summary, the feasibility is good, but deserved better detail, especially in the script part. \n",

      "The auditability of this proposal is high. The proponents claim that they will have a way of organizing themselves, through the Agile methodology (I would like to know more about this), and in relation to the community, they will create a “progress report that will be done through monthly meetings with the challenge team and coordinators' meetings with the IOG team”. In other words, it is very clear how the Cardano community could track partial results and gradual achievements. It would also be important for them to include in this report a session dedicated to talking about how the tasks were performed, that is, how the professionals' work routine took place in each month of this trajectory. Maybe this would be easier to visualize with the roadmap detail, but if they tell us about the goals and tasks, I think the auditability of the progress would be perfect. Now, speaking in final terms, we know that success is “successfully developing the adatar.me address book and getting users to use it to facilitate their asset transfers in Cardano”. We have a very accurate scenario that can be verified, did this really happen? Proponents also report what they expect to achieve for the project within 3 and 6 months of launch. I really believe that this idea will greatly benefit the Cardano community, because it would solve a problem that is common to all holders of Ada and digital wallets, and I think it would be interesting for proponents to conduct a user survey to find out how it went. the individual experience of each, as this application contributed to better adhesion of transactions on the blockchain. This research could be made publicly available to all members of our community. Therefore, I believe that the proponents provide us with good information on how the gradual advances would be perceived and what the successful scenario would look like, making it simple for us to understand (and monitor) if the proposal is following the intended path/results. \n",

      "This game can be perfectly summed up by the excerpt “Alternative to Tyranny (A2T) is a modular decentralized simulation game in which players develop and test strategies to thwart authoritarian control, censorship, disinformation and surveillance while developing decentralized alternative solutions to global issues such as climate change, war and poverty”. All activities done in the smart contract match game, according to the proponent, the game is a kind of evolution of the DAO-NET smart contract: Development Funder. In other words, we are already informed at the beginning of the proposal how Cardano's technologies will be used in this proposal. From what I understand, this game would also be a kind of catalyst for games, where players will receive tokens that can be assigned for the development of a proposal they are interested in. So it's as if this proposal is a small ecosystem that will be self-funding at some point of progress, using the technologies pertinent to our blockchain to grow and develop. Unfortunately, I found this idea as a whole a little confusing, because at the beginning of the impact description we get the impression that it will be a war simulation game and then the proponent talks about how this application intends to be a kind of Project Catalyst fully focused for games, with its own operation, but based on the Cardano blockchain. So I'm not so sure about the impact of this proposal, because really what I understood at first was that the objective would be, in the proponent's own words, \"to develop wargame simulation modules that provide alternative solutions to authoritarian responses to global crises”, and soon after we have a sudden change in the characteristics of the proposal. As much as it is an application that will use the technologies relevant to Cardano in an intensive way, which could generate a great popularization of our blockchain, increasing the number of active tokens and smart contracts minted in Cardano, the small confusion about understanding is not makes me so sure about the impact of the proposal; or whether this project will specifically meet the challenge's objectives. Therefore, I will give it 4 stars, because I think so, it can be something very positive for Cardano, but I think it would take longer explanations and also with a simpler and more accessible language for everyone, so that I could have complete certainty about the impact. of the proposal. \n",

      "The feasibility of the project is good, although not perfect. The script, for example, tells us which activities will be developed according to the months, but these activities are described in a superficial way. It would be interesting if we had more details, in this way we would better understand the development process to be done. For example, in June the “prototype free market proposal funding process” will be carried out. What will this process look like? What little activities would make it up? Who would work on it? What exactly is a prototype free market proposal? From the way the script is presented, we only have a notion of how the project would become reality, and much more detailed explanations could have been provided and in a language accessible to all. Talking now about the budget, 64 thousand dollars are requested, it is a high value, but it makes sense with the complexity of this project and with the tasks that will be carried out. The explanation of how the funding will be used is, in my view, superficial. The amounts are broken down into large amounts that are not well explained. For example, “2 Plutus Developers ($4,000/month): $48,000”. It would be important for us to have more information about their work routine, how many hours a week they would dedicate to the project, for example, so that we could have an idea of ​​the price of their work hour. In “Third-party smart contract audit: US$ 10,000”, it would be necessary for them to explain who these third parties are, how they would carry out the audit, for how long it would be carried out, at which stages of the project this would happen, and so on. Therefore, unfortunately, on the budget I consider the information given insufficient for us to have a satisfactory understanding. Finally, speaking of the team, this part of the project is great, at first we are explained what types of professionals would make up the team and their roles in this project, and then their names are said, a little about previous experiences, as if relate to Cardano and also their linkedin profiles.

      "I disagree that the auditability of the process is adequate, as it is not given information about the qualitative analyzes that the team would make, nor is it said how the team would contact the Cardano community, in order to pass on updates on each phase of the project. I really believe that they will organize themselves well internally, performing a good auditability of the tasks that have already been done, but it is necessary that such information is available to the entire Cardano community. What would be the agile methodology? Will reports be prepared at the end of the weekly meetings, to be delivered to the community, with a small summary of what was done in the week and what partial results were obtained? In my perception, the auditability of the process still left something to be desired. Now, talking about how we could monitor the final results, this part is great, the proponent explains in an extensive and detailed way what the application success scenario would look like. We know what is expected for it to be considered finished and successful, I just think it lacked to draw measurable consequences of all this for Cardano, beyond the game itself. That is, what was the increase in active community members from this game, how many smart contracts were added to our blockchain in X period of time, how this project contributed to greater Cardano adoption among the gaming public, and so on. It would be important for the bidder, his team and the community to have these metrics well defined. Therefore, I think that auditability is the part that could be better developed in the proposal, it's not bad, but it deserves improvement; both in terms of better understanding how the Cardano community could always be aware of everything that was being developed over the weeks, and in more objective ways to understand the consequences of the game for our ecosystem. \n",

      "The proposal is fully in line with the objectives of the challenge, as it intends to train women, more specifically in Cameroon, to educate them about Cardano, thus generating education and, in the future, an income for this community. According to the proponents, the DeFi community in Cameroon is already significant. I wish they had addressed a specific subject better, so that we could have a more detailed view of what happens there. It would be interesting for them to explain what is already happening, even if it has nothing to do with blockchain/Cardano, and support their statements with research and local reports, if any. In this way we would have a proof of the said scenario. I am not suspicious of the legitimacy of this information, I would just like to understand it better, to situate myself, because the expressiveness of these technologies is unique in a corner of the world and, except for a few exceptions, in places that are famous for their technological development, we are not able to know the characteristics and realities of each location. Other than that, I think the proposal is very good and perfectly achieves what we are looking for in the challenge: to finance proposals that benefit the inhabitants of Africa, generating opportunities to help communities, either through the development of humanitarian projects or through the education of their inhabitants. , so that they can work with Cardano and thus change their reality and also that of those around them; while, of course, our ecosystem is expanded, investment in Ada increases, Dapps are created, digital wallets, NFTs are minted on our blockchain and so on. This idea does exactly that: it helps the local community through education and in the future this will generate employment, I think it is even more special that the target audience is women, because the proportion between men and women who are part of our community is still very unequal. There are many, many men and rare women, so in my view all projects that give visibility and invest especially in this part of the population are already important in themselves. It is also clear because this investment would be long term, as proponents claim that Cardano is not very popular in the country, educating its inhabitants about this could start a wave of development in the place, who knows, men would also be interested and run after the many opportunities that our ecosystem has, in short, I think the idea is exactly what we are looking for in the challenge and has the potential to generate a very strong and positive impact. \n",

Starting with the analysis of the script, there is not one, per se. We know what would need to be done, but they are a series of activities described in a somewhat superficial way and without any temporal organization. It would be necessary for these tasks to be subdivided into months (from what I understand the project would last 1 year). What would happen in the first month? And in the second, and so on? In the way it is described, we have no way of knowing how long each thing will last and how it would relate to the others (activities that would take place in parallel, or if it would be necessary for one to end to start the other, etc.). I also feel that the description of the activities is done in a very superficial way, some of them needed more detail so that it was possible to understand them better. For example, in partnership with Wada, a very active and respected group here at Cardano (I've seen several of their proposals), a marketing campaign would be carried out. In what way? How would that disclosure be? Through which media? Would videos, texts, images be made? Would we have a specialized team with advertisers and designers ahead of this stage? Proponents say they would visit universities and technical schools to talk about Cardano. Which? In which cities? And why would each be chosen? How would they go about identifying female candidates who would fit the vacancy? What would the criteria be like, the selection? In general, this part of the proposal fills us with information, but without the necessary degree of detail and the organization needs so that we could fully understand it. The budget issue is also informed in a somewhat superficial way. There are 18k orders, in which: 3k go to marketing (we don't know how the campaign would be carried out, so it's also not possible to understand if the value is fair); 3k for prizes (which and how many prizes?); logistics, for example, involve many factors, so how would the 2k be distributed? Anyway, each part could have been more detailed, in order to generate a better understanding of whether the requested amount is justified or not. And finally, as far as the team is concerned, this part was great, we know exactly who we would be dealing with, their names, and previous experiences as well as their resumes through their linkedin profiles.

Female participation in hacktowns and Wada events would also be measured. These shapes are good for numerically understanding the consequences of the project, but a more detailed analysis would be appropriate here as well. In addition to monitoring how many women enrolled in the courses, an individualized follow-up of their learning process could be carried out. That is, to know if they are understanding the subjects, if they are able to program in the languages ​​taught, if they already have some projects in view in which they could intern to put into practice what they have learned, if they have any complaints or imminent problems... they should be followed up afterwards, where they are after the program, have they become active members of the Cardano community, whether through Catalyst, Wada or other initiatives that somehow belong to our blockchain? This research should be done in order to understand the impact of the courses both on their lives and on Cardano. Regarding the monitoring of the process, this is not so possible since we do not have a definition of dates, that is, deadlines to be met so that the goal is reached. If there was a schedule, I think it would be easier to monitor whether the proposed activities were being done at the right time and in the right way too. In other words, in my view, the auditability established here says much more about the results than about the process, when both parties lack monitoring. \n",

      "The proposal meets the objectives of the challenge well, although I think some things could be better explained. In summary, the proponent wants to promote a series of actions that aim to introduce the Cardano ecosystem to the inhabitants of India. According to him, the adoption of new technologies is slower in this country due to the cultural and language diversity present in it. I would like him to explain how this exact point would be overcome - would the content produced be translated into different languages? How would these contents dialogue with such a diverse audience, respecting everyone's particularities and making knowledge accessible to different groups? Regarding the activities that are developed, there will be in general 3: the \"weekly meetings in Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad / Social Works\", and the use of the following platforms - \"Virtual platform for events - KonmaVerse\" and \"Communication platform - Tribe Cardano India in Konmahood”. What I think should have been better explained is how these face-to-face meetings would take place. We know where they would be, however: what subjects would be addressed, exactly? I believe that at first, these are introductory subjects regarding the Cardano ecosystem, such as “what is blockchain, what are cryptocurrencies and what is Cardano and Catalyst”. However, it would be necessary for the author to make this issue very explicit. Without knowing the exact topics that will be covered, we cannot clearly visualize what these events will be like. We also don't know how many people he seeks to bring together by meeting and how they will be captivated to participate, as apparently blockchain technology and Cardano are still little-known subjects in the country. The proponent could also have explained in more detail what the online activities would look like on the two aforementioned platforms, we know that the intention is to keep event participants and interested parties connected, however, would only conversation chats be created or would something else be done there? We know the target audience of the project, but it would be interesting, as I said, for the proponent to clarify how he will make them aware and persuade them to participate in these meetings and virtual spaces. It is positive how, right from the impact, the proponent tells us which KPIs are targeted for the project, as this generates a sense of purpose that is very useful from the beginning, that is, we know what will be done and for what it will be done. It is also positive how he foresees possible difficulties and ways to overcome them, which demonstrates a lot of planning in relation to the context. Therefore, I think the proposal makes a lot of sense with this challenge, as it would certainly help in the popularization of Cardano, generating benefits for both our blockchain and the local community.

We have many things at stake here during pre-production, such as: defining a speaker (if any), defining what topics will be addressed at each meeting, how long the meetings will last, how people will be persuaded to participate, if there will be any type of dynamic so that there is more public engagement, if there will be awards in these dynamics, which awards, if there will be a time for networking, if there will be food... Anyway, there are many factors to be combined, this part of the planning should be better explained . Regarding the appointment and training of staff, this should also be detailed, how will the staff be trained, and who will train them? The budget is also explained in a somewhat superficial way. We know that the amount spent per event will be 700 dollars, but it is not defined why that price would be; we know that moderates will receive $100 per event, but we don't know what they would do and how many hours they would work before, during, and after the events; and 6800 dollars will be earmarked for marketing and public relations, but it is not detailed how the marketing will be done, for example, what strategies will be adopted and by what means this campaign will be publicized. As it is presented to us, the budget explanation is very basic, not being able to generate full understanding. Regarding the team, it's a duo, I would like as much information to be provided about Fred Jonathan as there was about Sathya Vijayan. Ideally, for both of them there would be a small curriculum explaining previous work, it would also be important for them to clarify how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem. It's positive how they attach their linkedin profiles, because there we can see in practice some of the experiences they've had so far. Anyway, I think the feasibility is ok, but there are points to be really improved. \n",

      "The proponents give a lot of information that can be used as a way to monitor the project development process, I believe it was lacking to clarify how this information would be taken to the Cardano community. Would monthly reports be prepared with partial results included? Would online and collaborative tools be created, where bidders would periodically post updates and the community would have access to check what changed from time to time? There are several ways to establish this bridge, either through the community's own communication channels (such as telegram and discord) or through online tools such as Notion, Miro, Medium and etc. It is necessary that direct contact be established between the proponents, their tasks and the Cardano community. In addition to knowing if the goals for a certain period of time were reached, we also need to understand if the pair worked properly, that is, if they fulfilled all the tasks that were planned for that period of time, if there were problems and how they were overcome, etc. . Regarding the final results, I found the visualization of the success scenario to be correct, but superficial. The desire here is “to see a community of India actively participating in the Cardano ecosystem and Project Catalyst and taking on various roles as CAs, proponents and voters”. However, how could all this be perceived, how would such information be monitored and how would it become known to the Cardano community? I think proponents need to outline ways to verify such a scenario, prove that such impacts really happened through real life examples, maybe even some project participants could join us and we could all talk after Town Hall, to deeply understand that consequences this project generated. So I think the auditability of the project is ok, as is the feasibility, but it needs more detail on how the information would reach the Cardano community and more detailed explanations on how the success scenario would be perceived in real life. \n",

      "The idea is good, but it could be better explained. I agree that design is an extremely relevant field for the Cardano ecosystem, and having figures that were specially created to circulate through our ecosystem, being the result of research and a meticulous work of professionals in the area, is a good way to deal with this design issue, and can bring positive results. However, the proposal is still a bit superficial, in my opinion. We are told that 20 unique figures would be created, however, what would be the themes portrayed in each of them? What message would these figures seek to convey? In what contexts could they be used? And how would that help new people who don't know Cardano, its technologies and differentials, to become active members of the community? I think what was lacking here was to explain, in addition to the process of creating the figures, how they would actually act within our ecosystem. It is unclear, once they are ready, where these figures would be made available or what the Cardano community would do with them. The objective of this challenge is to facilitate the entry of new members into the ecosystem, as it is a fact that for those who do not know Cardano, Catalyst, etc., to understand everything that goes on here, from our technologies to where you could fit in this diverse community. and complex, it is not a simple task. Could some of these figures be part of a guide on our blockchain? Would they have an educational role in the understanding process, and consequently, in the addition of new people to the ecosystem? It would be necessary to clarify how this figure would contribute to the achievement of the specific objectives of the challenge, which are, for example: new active members in the community, who buy and delegate Ada, as well as CNFTs, who work for Catalyst, who help or invest in the development of Dapps... Anyway, that are really active in the community and make an impact for the growth of the blockchain. Unfortunately, it is not so clear what the impact of these figures would be on our ecosystem, I think this proposal could better fit the challenge of new media, for example, because perhaps these figures could be added to the production of texts about Cardano that could circulate in different types of media (like websites about economics, for example)... I don't know, it was just a use that I thought was quite relevant. I'm not saying that it's a bad idea and that the production of these figures wouldn't really add to the Cardano ecosystem, but that it all doesn't relate so clearly to the goals of this challenge, with the attempt to attract new active members to our community. . \n",

      "The script is reasonable, because we know which phases would be worked on (research, design and art, in addition to the administrative issue), and we also know the average time they would take. However, I think these phases could be more detailed. In terms of research, for example, what sources do the authors of the proposal intend to use to acquire the necessary knowledge to produce the engravings? It would be essential for them to say what subjects they are thinking of approaching, there are 20 pictures, would each of them be about a different theme or would there be 5 themes with 4 pictures each? How will it be decided which themes would have how many engravings on? In terms of design and art, we are told that the proponents have other commitments besides the execution of this project, which makes us wonder how much time, in reality, they will dedicate to carry out this work. What would your work routines be like for making sketches, for experimenting with colors, textures, etc? How many hours per week do they plan to dedicate to this project? In the administration part, the bidders could have explained what exactly would constitute this step. What will be administered? The working time, the topics chosen, the availability of drafts? It gets a little confusing because the project wouldn't have a big team (it would be 2 illustrators, from what I understand), there wouldn't be so many different activities to manage either (I'll give an example to make it clearer - when we are designing a game, many and many things will be created and worked on, illustrations, narration, UI/UX design, programming, etc. In this case, I can visualize what the administration process would be like, because it is a multifaceted work, but in the case of this project, I don't it is very clear the need a thousand dollars directly for this part). Regarding funding, I disagree that the amount is well justified, asking for 9500 dollars, which would result in a total of 475 dollars for illustration, which is a very high amount. The parts into which the total amount would be divided should be better explained. For example, as I mentioned in the administration part, why do you need a thousand dollars for this? In the design and art part, they would add up to 6 thousand dollars, but we have no idea of ​​exactly how much time the proponents would dedicate to the project, we know the total number of weeks. But do you agree that in a week they could work 3 hours a day, or 3 hours a week? If they had specified exactly how much time they would dedicate to the project, we could calculate the hourly value of their work and see if it would be fair value or not. Regarding the preparation of the authors, little information is given about them, we know that they have already worked for the Terra Cognita project, which is a game that was financed by fund 7. This is good, as it indicates that they already have some experience working within of the Cardano ecosystem. However, we would need to know more, for greater trust to be passed. What are your professional backgrounds, what are your previous jobs besides participating in Terra Cognita? Do they have experience with other Catalyst projects? As they are illustrators and designers, it would be essential that they attach a portfolio where we could see their previous work. So, about the duo, I think the presentation was superficial and didn't convey that much confidence. \n",

      "Regarding how we could follow the development of the project, I think this part was too superficial. We are told that there would be 20 figures in total (as I mentioned before) and that they could be presented in blocks of 5 figures. However, this would correspond to the delivery of partial results, and would not exactly be a monitoring of the work process itself. When seeing see, it is essential that the proponents update the Cardano community weekly on how their work routines have been. This can be done by Miro, for example, as it is an online tool where you can post both videos and texts. I think it would be great if they created a panel on Miro and at the end of each week they would inform us, for example: what were the results of the work that week (in the research phase, they could point out some topics studied, in the project phase, they could attach some sketches or ideas for colors, textures, repetitions, etc.); it would also be important for them to explain about the work routine itself, that is, did they really fulfill the workload that was planned? Was there a problem where they couldn't deliver all the results they thought for that period of time? I believe that if this more detailed monitoring were carried out, instead of just seeing partial deliveries, we could also understand the work that was carried out to get us there. Regarding the final result, I think they were also a little superficial in building a successful scenario. It would be interesting for them to do some research to understand where their images were circulating, what uses were attributed to them by the Cardano community, how this contributed to the addition of new members to the ecosystem... in other words, in practice , how can the impact be noticed? If this research were carried out and the results were taken to the members of the Cardano community, I believe that in fact we would have a good auditability of the final results, a more qualitative analysis than quantitative analysis. I generally suggest that both natures (qualitative and quantitative) be explored in auditability, but in this case I think it's even more important to realize how these prints are being used than how many people are doing it. \n",

      "The idea is good, the proponent suggests that a series of meetings be held, both face-to-face and online, to help French-speakers in Burkina Faso learn about Cardano. In theory, the proposal meets the objectives of the challenge well, because these meetings would basically be workshops that would address initial and in-depth topics about our blockchain in the future, with the intention that the premise that blockchain is just a way of investing in cryptocurrencies is undone. In fact, this prejudice is rooted in most people, except in places where blockchain is already a well-known and strong technology, such as the United States and Europe. In this African country, I believe that the level of prejudice is very high due to the lack of education of the population, so it is essential that this type of event is created and changes this reality. However, I think there was a lack of detail to better understand the idea, for example, we are told the thematic axes of the meetings. However, the specific issues are not mentioned. Within the introduction to blockchain, what specific topics would be covered? For example: what is blockchain, what is Cardano, what are cryptocurrencies, NFTs... And how will this information be taught in an accessible way to the target audience? I think in theory it is a proposal that perfectly fits the objective of bringing new members to the Cardano community, mainly because it is about a country where our blockchain is unknown and there is a lot of deep-rooted prejudice. However, in my opinion it would be important for us to know more details about how things would happen, how these teachings would be addressed, through which language would be passed on, who the speakers would be, how they would be able to draw the attention of the target audience and the like. In short, details about the project itself, as it would happen in practice, in everyday life. Therefore, I will give it 4 stars, because I trust the potential of this proposal and it is very much in line with the challenge in which it was launched, but it needs a more in-depth explanation. \n",

      "I do not agree that the feasibility of the project is very good, the information given is quite basic. As I said in Impact, not much detail is presented about the practice of the project. The script is quite superficial, dividing the tasks according to the passage of months. The problems are that both the time interval between the phases is very long and the explanation of what would happen in the phases is very superficial. For example in the first 3 months, we basically know that the workshops would be to introduce the blockchain, talk about the opportunities it presents and how to participate in Catalyst. But, as I mentioned before: how many meetings will there be, who will speak, what are the specific topics of these 3 thematic axes, what is the numerical expectation of audience, how to engage them, in which parts of the two cities these meetings would take place... And online dating, how could this be possible considering that the target audience does not have a good internet connection? As with phase 1, the following should be better explained. In phase two, the topic “more details on the Cardano blockchain” will be addressed. What details? What was not said in phase 1 that would be talked about now? On the budget, 6k USD is requested, which is a small amount compared to most proposals. But the splitting of parts could also be more specific, for example 2500 USD would go towards a number of things: “event logistics, venue costs, French materials, food etc”. Basically the production of events. But how much would every little thing like that be? What is the average rental for the place? The donations in Ada would go to who, the participants of the event? And finally, talking about the team, in fact it is a duo, we know their names and a small resume of each, but it was necessary to explain their individual role in the project (will they be the speakers?), how much each would commit to the project, it would also be interesting if profiles of their social networks were attached, with facebook or linkedin, where we could see their previous achievements in a practical way. With that, my conclusion is that the feasibility needs to be deepened, mainly in the script part. \n",

      "The auditability of the project is pretty superficial too. As a measure of progress, the goal is to add 20 participants to the Cardano community per month, and for final results it is expected that 12 workshops will be held with a total of 160 new participants in the community at the end of the events. However, these ways of measuring success are entirely numerical, quantitative. It would be more interesting if qualitative aspects were also analyzed. Auditability in my view should be divided into two parts: monitoring the process (partial results) + monitoring the goals (final results). About process monitoring, this is not so easy to do as we don't have a detailed roadmap. We only know what will happen, in a basic way, as I said, it would be necessary to establish some phases, with well-defined deadlines. With that, we would have more material to monitor, if what we want happened and in the right way and at the right time. The duo that promotes the events should prepare monthly reports, where at the end of each month the partial results are presented, and this should be very accessible to the entire Cardano community, either through online tools such as google docs or miro, or if the document sent directly to our Project Catalyst telegram group. The final results must be explored in a richer way, both in terms of numbers, which are indeed indispensable data to understand if they were achieved, but they must also be analyzed in a more humane way. Are meeting participants really active in the community? If yes, how? Have they learned enough about Catalyst to become CAs and vCAs? And those who study and work with technology, how are they associated with our projects, are they working on the technical parts? Seeing that it is the obligation of the proponents to update the Cardano community, I would like meetings to be held in order to analyze together the final results of this project. This has space to be done in the specific rooms after Town Hall, for example. It is not necessary for all participants of the weekly ecosystem meeting to participate in this, but at least some. In this way, I believe that auditability can be done in a more adequate and complete way. \n",

      "This challenge aims to popularize the use of Atala Prism's decentralized identities, and I think this proposal serves that goal well. The idea here is to create “a registry-based website to allow Cardano-based DID validation by school boards”. Proponents argue that one problem with adopting DIDs is trust in their issuers, and then that these “rely on being members of established networks, leading to DID fragmentation”. I would like to understand this sentence better. I am not from the technology area, as I believe that many CAs and readers of the proposal are not either, so I cannot understand why, when establishing the issuance in some network, the decentralized identities would be fragmented, nor how this fragmentation would be. Well, in my opinion it would be important for the problem in question to be further explained and argued. Now, moving on to the suggested solution, it is a question of creating a platform in which DIDs are issued in a secure manner. I would like to know how this platform would overlap with the others, why would it be considered more secure, what would be its usability characteristics. I would also like the format of the DIDs generated here to be better defined, in which they would differ from the others, according to the proponents, they would be human-readable formats; the others are not? Why would they be simpler? It would be very interesting if the proponents, for example, had created a prototype to visualize the DIDs, so that we could visualize exactly what they intend to do. I also think that another point of the proposal that is a little vague is the issue of adoption by school boards, during the description of the impact this issue is not brought up again. Only that the proponents participated in a hub in Africa, with the aim of teaching promotion language relevant to the Cardano ecosystem, and that somehow the first DIDs that students would have would be generated. I think this whole experience could have been reported in more detail, would that be the starting point for the idea? Which educational institutions do the proponents aim to work with? Anyway, the crux of the matter is correct and well aligned with the challenge, but in general I think the explanations could be a little longer and more enlightening, so that we have a better understanding of the impact that would be generated here. \n",

      "The feasibility of the project is ok, and could have been better explored in the parts of the roadmap and the budget explanation. Starting with the analysis of the script: there is indeed an explanation of what would be according to the months of the year that would follow, however these explanations are very superficial, in fact they are just mentions of what is to come. For example, in the first month of project development, a collection of public key from higher education institutions would be carried out. How would these keys be collected? Which institutions will participate in the program, and how will their students be introduced to this initiative and captivated to issue their decentralized identities? From July to October, it is said that “a website with API connectivity to the blockchain to verify DIDs” would be created. In this time interval we have 4 months: what would happen in each of them? What small activities would be necessary for the site to be created? How would these DIDs be verified? Which professionals would be working in this part of the project and how? I think that all the steps could be better detailed, especially those that relate to a longer time frame. Now, talking about the budget division, the amount requested is quite fair and compatible with the proposal, in my opinion. However, it is also explained in a superficial way, the parts it is divided into are not well justified. For example, $2,000 would be used for marketing. What would be traded? Who would promote this marketing, who would the public consume? They are asking for 9 thousand dollars for the site with validation features, it would be interesting if this part was especially broken down as it is the most expensive part of the budget. What would these features look like? I think it's possible to understand how the money would be used because the parts are clear and to the point, but they are unduly detailed. Finally, speaking of the team, this is the part that got better, in my view. We know who the 4 professionals involved are, what they make of their professionals, examples of some projects with which they have already been involved; we know who is related to our blockchain and also how (for example, we know that Paul is already learning Plutus); we also know almost everyone's linkedin profile (except Bandu, I wish he had made this link available or even another site, such as github itself, so that we had a working knowledge of their work).

Several ways in which the Cardano community could follow the development of the project are mentioned, but it is not clear if only the final results will be explained or if the work routines of the professionals involved would also be monitored (which I think is important). I loved the idea of ​​making videos where students report their experiences with DIDs, I just want to know how many videos they plan to release and also how often; how often will they also update the github repository? Are the meetings they cite with the IOG coordinators? Anyway, in general, it is pertinent information and that demonstrates that the team was concerned with several ways to make the process auditable, but these doubts could have been resolved, more details could have been attached about each of the parts. Finally, analyzing the final results, in relation to the website with updates from the school councils, what would be updated, which website is this? Again, how often would these updates be available? How will the aforementioned membership fees be measured? I think the proponents could have been more specific on this part of the proposal, detailing better the ways that success could be ascertained. It would be great if they had plotted some KPIs, quantitative and qualitative data to see if the project was successful and if the specific objectives of the challenge were achieved; in general: if a considerable number of students started to issue Atala Prism DIDs, what was that experience like, if somehow they became interested in the cryptographic universe and more specifically in Cardano; if this project generated other fruits for our community, such as if these students became active members of our community and so on.

A little more study would be needed before this proposal could be launched, in my view, as it is not clear what in practice would be developed for this reality to become. It will also be clear that the goals of the challenge will not be as clear as the goals of the challenge, how will they also become popular in relation (between Eros and Cardano) our blockchain? That current users will learn to deal with Cardano technologies, and maybe users can learn to other world technologies - NFTs, how to buy Ada in pool - NFTs, etc.?

The budget is also explained in a very detailed way, although at this point I think some information was missing. For example, in marketing, you would be charged a monthly fee of 3500 dollars. We know who would work here (a graphic designer) and what he would do, but we don't know how many hours per week he would dedicate to this project. Therefore, it is not possible to have such a complete understanding of whether the requested money is fair, because it would vary greatly according to the hours of work that would be done. I would like these details to be added. Finally, speaking of the team, we know the names of everyone involved, as well as their resumes (well summarized, in my opinion this part should be more extensive), previous experiences and their linkedin profiles. In this way, we can verify the information that was said. I think the problem with the team is that we don't have any experts in Cardano, so there is no confidence in the preparation of this team to deal with our blockchain technologies.

It is not so clear to me what content from the sprints would be posted and how the Cardano community would have access to it, however, we cannot say that the author does not care about drawing a solid bridge between his project and the members of the Cardano community. However, some doubts came to my mind: how often would these updates be made? I believe it is necessary for the proponent to better detail what will be done so that we can monitor the day-to-day construction of the project, which includes monitoring the work routine of all the professionals involved as well as the partial goals achieved. These updates should be at least monthly, in my view. Regarding the final results, success would come with (Aeros) “Becoming the first Airmile token in the world to be integrated with many airlines and loyalty programs”. However, it is necessary, as I mentioned in the impact, that the consequences of this for the Cardano ecosystem are better explained. After the proposer has carried out these analyses, he must provide this information in a precise and easy way to the Cardano community, which could be done by preparing a final report or even the participation of the author of the proposal in Town Hall, for example.

      "The idea here is to create a youtube channel that teaches basic concepts about blockchain and Cardano, such as how to acquire Ada, create a digital wallet, generate passive income through staking and etc. This is something very positive, however, which already exists in large quantities. The platform on which Cardano has the most space and viewers is youtube, so much so that in the end 7 we created a challenge precisely to be able to disseminate content related to our ecosystem in other, more traditional types of media, so that we can reach a wider audience. So, even though in theory it is important to bring knowledge about Cardano to India, I don't see much need to create videos explaining these basic concepts, since they are already available and accessible to everyone. In addition, starting a channel from scratch would create the need for a lot of marketing to get interesting visibility. In my opinion, we could have a more interesting approach to the problem here if, for example, the proponent subtitled some videos that already exist in Indian, instead of creating them from scratch. He could organize these videos into a playlist, as a kind of introductory course on our blockchain, subtitle them and perhaps establish a question and answer session about the contents that were studied. It would be great to create a group of students, let's call it that, and support them, instead of creating more of the same, deepening what already exists, making it more accessible, answering questions and individually guiding young Indians who are interested in learning our Cardano , what our ecosystem can offer of opportunities, if they are from the technology area and are interested in learning about our computing languages, for example, or how to build Dapps and etc. Or, if these students are from other areas (outside of design, programming and all those professional positions that are highly targeted at Cardano), they can also understand how they fit into the community, because the proposals also need non-technical professionals in those areas , or even to work as CAs on Catalyst. Anyway, the idea is good, but I think it could be adapted to the current reality, where there are many videos already on the subject, and it could be invested in deeper and individual guidance of the intended target audience. \n",

      "The feasibility of this project is average, we were able to understand in general what would be done, but at the same time it lacks a lot of detail. It is said the frequency and what would be the themes of the videos to be created. However, nothing is said about the creation process itself. The proponent wants to release 2 videos a week, but how big are they? How would he go about raising them? Would a script be written, then recorded, edited, narrated? It is a bit abstract how the development process would actually take place, what small steps would have to be completed in order for such videos to be generated. Therefore, I would like the proponent to include in this part of the proposal a script that explains in detail their creative process, how many hours or days each stage of creation would require, etc. Now talking about the budget, we know that you will be charged a value of 13 dollars per hour of work, which would give an average of at least 260 dollars of cost per video, considering that it would take a minimum time of 20 hours to create. I found it a little high, since we don't even know their size, so we don't know exactly how much work would be dedicated to each video. All the money would go to the proponent, I am concerned that he has no affiliation with any other professional to carry out this project, we know that he is technically qualified because he claims to be a postgraduate engineer in cinema in media, but I don't think the best solution is work alone. From my point of view, it would be interesting for him to hire at least someone from the marketing area to help with the promotion of the channel and videos. In fact, nothing is said about it, all the money asked would correspond to the cost of producing the videos, but how would it be advertised? When seeing seeing, as important as creating quality content is to publicize it, so that it can reach your target audience and the largest possible number of people. So I think it is a flaw that the proponent did not mention this at any time in the proposal, nor if he himself would work on promoting the channel or if someone else would be responsible for it, in addition to what marketing strategies would be adopted here. Finally, about the team, as I already mentioned, this proposal would apparently be developed only by the proposer. He gives good information about who he is, his background, etc. But it would be interesting if a formal resume was attached, either through your linkedin profile or another platform. This way we would have a secure proof of the information that is passed. We don't know how the proponent understands Cardano, how he relates to the blockchain, if he is an active member of the community and yes, through what actions... That way, not so much confidence is passed about his preparation in teach about our blockchain. \n",

      "The bidder did not include very precise information on how to audit his bid. He says that progress will be measured by the content posted on youtube as well as the number of youtube subscribers, as well as how they interact with the videos. The expected number of subscribers is at least 50k and 20k portfolios created from the teachings disseminated. In fact, these are logical ways to measure the success of the proposal, but they are also superficial, because they seek to analyze only numbers, and not how, exactly, people exposed to the contents would be affected. My suggestions are that the proponent first establish a script for creating the videos, and as he develops his project he can give feedback to the community about what it was like to work with it. As it is a simple project, compared to other Catalyst proposals, this feedback can also be provided in a simple and direct way. It could be a short report that contains this information about the video creation process. Whether the activities were carried out as planned, whether any difficulties were encountered, etc. And regarding the results, we could keep the indicatives suggested by the author and increase the interaction with the subscribers. A direct meeting could be held with them, in order to listen to them, both in terms of doubts and to understand their progress. How are these people relating to Cardano, becoming active members of the community, etc? All this could be clarified through direct contact. It would be important that, in addition to knowing how many subscribers and portfolios were created, the proponent would inform us at what level and activities these people are after the teachings. Anyway, these are suggestions on how to further deepen auditability, I agree that it is possible to measure it satisfactorily, but not ideally, through what the proponent suggests. \n",

      "I think the proposal works very well with the specific objectives of the challenge, I did a brief research and saw that the Marathi language is spoken by about 90 million Indians, that is, it is an extremely popular language there. Therefore, translating videos from very relevant youtube channels that talk about Cardano, such as Emurgo, Cardano Foundtain and the IOHK channel, will be able to bring to many Indians safe and accessible knowledge about our blockchain. We know that the main difficulty for non-English speakers is understanding complex content in a language other than their mother tongue. It is not simple to learn about blockchain, about cryptocurrencies, go beyond the basics that people usually know, understand the differences and advantages of the Cardano ecosystem in relation to other blockchains, let alone if this is not taught in our own language. Therefore, if the contents of the aforementioned channels and a few others (which ones? It would be good to know them so that we know that they are as reliable as those that are said) were properly translated into Marathi, the speakers of that language will have a much simpler access to contents that surround the Cardano ecosystem. With this, doors will open, they will discover opportunities for both investment (like buying and delegating ada, for example) and extra income (if they work as CAs and vCAs on Catalyst, for example). Or even, if they are people in the technology, legal and business areas, the areas that most need manpower in the proposals, they can find a steady and very profitable job here. Thus, the objective of benefiting India would be fully achieved. Logically, the Cardano ecosystem would also benefit a lot in this story, as new members would be added to the community, who can become investors, project workers, who will likely create digital wallets, Ada, CNFTs, which will help in the creation of Dapps ; in general: they will make our blockchain grow, as we dream so much. I truly believe that this proposal has the potential for maximum, extremely positive impact. However, I think it could be better explained which contents exactly will be translated, which specific subjects, in which order and etc, as I will comment better on the topic of feasibility. Restricting myself to impact, this project, in my opinion, deserves top marks. \n",

      "Regarding the money, I think this could have been explained better. We don't know what the marketing campaign will be like, so I can't justify the need for $1200 to be set aside for this. I don't know what a contingency fee would be, I would like the concept of this to be explained and also why it would cost 2 thousand dollars. Regarding the money requested for translations themselves, I think it could be measured in another way, it is not feasible to audit whether as many words were actually translated as promised. It would be safer, in terms of verification, if the price was defined by video minutes or even by the hourly rate of the person working on that part. About the team, this part of the proposal is very good, the participants are presented in an individualized way and very rich in details. Their names are said, a long description of professional activities they have performed so far, social network profiles are attached to most of them, etc. My suggestion for improvement is to clarify who would do what within this project. Now about the planning schedule, that is, the roadmap: the activities are not explored with the same richness of detail that we found in the team's presentation, it is said that they would be done in the 3 months of the project in a very shallow way. The first month would be more about organizing the team and starting the translations, while in the others, content production and videos would be continued. As I mentioned in impact: we would like to understand what subjects would be addressed, in what order, how basic knowledge would be deepened, if there would be any kind of contact with the subscribers, to clarify if they had doubts. In general, but details about the generated content. In general, I think the feasibility still has a lot of work to do, so I'll keep a neutral opinion here. \n",

      "Finally, let's assess whether the proposal is auditable. I think that in addition to the monthly verification of translated videos on youtube, the team should provide more complete feedback at the end of each month. It can be a summary of how the activities were developed in that period of time, if everything went as planned, if the translators followed their work routines with commitment, if the promised minutes for the month were delivered, if there were problems between the team or in the generation of content... Realizing if the final result of each month was delivered is important, essential, but knowing the pre-production of that too. Regarding the final results, I think we should go beyond a quantitative listing of information such as number of subscribers, comments, hours viewed, etc. How would the target audience be absorbing the content learned? It would be very useful if they created some way for these people to communicate continuously, like a group on telegram, for example, through which they could help each other and where a survey could be launched after the 3 months of the project. This research would aim to understand more fully how the translations affected Marathi speakers. How are they participating in the Cardano ecosystem now? Did they become a bidder, or CAs, vCas? Are you studying about plutus, in the case of programmers? Are designers looking for projects to work on? Have investments by this part of India's population increased? If yes, how? All this should be clarified and taken to the community, either through a video on youtube, posted on the channel itself, a final report written and sent to the Project Catalyst telegram channel, anyway... I think the suggested auditability is good , but not enough for us to audit the proposal with the ideal specificity. \n",

      "Excellent idea and that fits very well with the objectives of the challenge. This talks about a kind of game (it can also be inserted in the challenge of the worlds) that the objective is to learn some language through the exploration of spaces, which would be the games of the worlds. Each would correspond to a language, and the entire context would be adapted to the player's proficiency level. I find this interesting in several ways of flow, because as the proponents themselves say, traditional teaching often follows a pre-defined pattern, where the student has to adapt to learning. In this game, the opposite would happen. I would contribute to student engagement/games as progress would not be too many tasks and it would be too hard, in a fun and challenging way. An excerpt that can pretty much sum up how this all relates to the Cardano ecosystem is “all governed worlds and their contents are built, inhabited, owned and curated by independent DAOs consisting of first language speakers (L1-), language professionals and high-level players (the latter need to succeed in an assessment first)”. Or a lot, as our blockchain technologies are used in all parts of our blockchain, which is great for us as it will increase or increase the number of transactions of our blockchain and it is also an organic form of popularization. People would come to the game to learn the languages, not to get to know Cardano, but that would happen automatically. Furthermore, the proponents and the statement that “we are also integrating Atala PRISM DIDs into our DAOs to independently prove their learning progress, language and game proficiency by in-game VCs”. That is, more and more ways in which Cardano serialized. Next, the proponents go on to explain in very detail the game's universe, the game experience, which ones would be addressed, other questions about the project (such as who would have the active token that would be transformed to Adada) and so on. a video, a kind of trailer, through which we can have a very realistic view of the game set to come. I loved the idea and I think it deserves the funding. \n",

      "Like the previous topic, this part of the proposal is ideal. We know reasonably detailed information about the three main parts to be analyzed, the roadmap, the budget and the team. There is not much to say, but I will comment on each topic individually. Starting with the roadmap, the proponents indicate which activities would be developed each month, which allows us to solidly visualize the process. The only suggestion I could make is that this explanation could be more detailed in the sense that: we know exactly what would happen in each week of these months. Thus, we would have an even deeper understanding of what is to come. Regarding the budget, we are told that this proposal is a complement to the main proposal, in which the salaries of the professionals involved constituted the funding. Here, more money is asked so that they can dedicate themselves even more to the project. I believe we understand quite clearly how the total amount will be divided and used. Finally, speaking of the team, we know each of those involved very well, individually and in detail. We know their names, their professional areas, previous works and which of them have some kind of connection with Cardano, which are active members of our community. A valid suggestion would be that, ideally, everyone should attach their linkedin profiles or other sites (as many have done), so that we can get to know their previous experiences in practice and have proof of what is said. There is a lot of confidence in the ability of this team to successfully develop the project. So, one more topic getting full marks, but consider some improvements I suggested. \n",

      "The proposal is highly auditable, the proponents point out many KPIs (short and long term) that could be used as measurable objectives, to verify if the game was achieving partial results. Regarding the measurement of progress, I was just a little unsure how this data would easily reach all members of the Cardano community. We know what to monitor, but how will it be monitored? I believe that the team will periodically meet with the IOG coordinators, as this is the standard to be followed, but it would also be positive if they clarified how this information could reach the other members of the Cardano ecosystem. Other than that, I think the auditability of progress is very strong, due to the large amount of data we can verify. Talking about the success scenario, the proponents indicate some scenarios to be conquered such as “we intend to finish the base content of the game and iterate on the MVP”, and also “the finalization of the basic linguistic content for each language to define common bases and approaches for learning”, in addition to “we hope to include some first PRISM components and start the formation of test-DAOs”. My view is that there is a situation similar to the auditability of progress, we have a lot of information about what would have to be obtained, but there is not so much clarity on how to bridge the gap between this team and the Cardano community. My suggestion here is that they participate in some Town Hall or moment after this meeting, because I think this project is super interesting and could prove to be extremely beneficial for Cardano, deserving a space in the most important meeting of our community. In this way, a summary could be made of the advances achieved with the financing, whether the desired scenarios were achieved, etc. Therefore, I will give it 4 stars, because I think the auditability is good, but it could be improved by making it clearer how everything will reach the active members of our community. \n",

      "I really liked this idea and I think it fits perfectly with the objectives of the challenge. Here, we seek to fund projects that are beneficial to both Cardano and developing countries. And in the case of this proposal, this is exactly what happens: the idea is to create a Dapp that would serve to connect customers with broken/defective technological devices with repairmen/professionals who work with the repair of these devices, be it a cell phone, a computer, a tablet and etc. This would certainly benefit the locality, as it would help these informal workers to get more services and clients, thus helping to generate income for the inhabitants of Ghana; it would also make it easier for the general population to have access to this service, as the intention is to register as many repairmen as possible on Dapp, and according to the proponent, this type of service is not so easy to find in the country. Therefore, the objective of benefiting the local population of a developing country would be directly served. And, on the other hand, the Cardano ecosystem would also benefit, as this platform would use the technologies of our ecosystem in different ways. All contact between customers and repairers would take place through smart contracts, so that all services and payments would be easily traceable, transparent and inviolable. Repairmen would have DIDs, through which customers, as I understand it, would be able to consult a series of information about them, and in this way they would have more knowledge when choosing the appropriate professional for the service they wish to perform. In my view, it is a very practical, very everyday and palpable way of using blockchain, if this project is right, I believe it can be a good example of how blockchain technology is useful and applicable to the everyday life of ordinary people. My only concerns here are how these repairmen would be found, how they would be taught how to use the Dapp, it is said that they would receive a small reward in Ada for signing up. But the question is how they would learn to register, for example, create a DID and so on. And in the same way, as these teachings would be passed on to the inhabitants of Ghana, in my opinion it is not common for people to know how to use Dapps and carry out transactions on the blockchain, especially in countries where this technology is not so famous. Therefore, the question of instructing both repairers and customers could have been clarified. \n",

      "The feasibility of the project is good, but there are some things to improve. About the script, we know what will happen as the months pass, but I identify two problems here. First, the time chosen to divide the steps is very large, the activities that will take place every 4 months are listed! Generally, proposals divide their stages into quarterly, which I already consider to be an extensive interval, let alone 4 months. In my opinion, this division should be at least monthly (ideally, activities should be divided into months and those into weeks). With that, we would have a very solid notion of the process as a whole, because the way it is presented, for example in the first 4 months, we don't know when an activity would need to end for another to start, if some could happen in parallel, etc. Now speaking of the activities themselves, we know what will happen, but very superficially; it would be important for the proponent to further explain each of these activities. For example, in phase 3: “Start marketing strategy”, how would this be done? Through which strategies would this Dapp be publicized, would it be through social media, traditional media? How would we go about reaching a population that doesn't have so much access to the internet, which often isn't all family members who have their own smartphones? In 'Organize educational outreach', what would that look like? Would it be the case to publicize the project in educational institutions, or teach how to use Dapp, as I suggested in Impact? Anyway, some activities needed an extra explanation, I don't think the script is built properly. The same thing is repeated in the case of the budget, the amount requested in total is very very high. $74,500 is requested, and the breakdown of the whole is not so detailed. What would be the fees quoted under “Company registration and legal fees - $5,000”, and why would this amount be necessary for that? Why would research and design cost $7,000, how long would professionals in this area work to assemble the interface, what would the UI/UX design of the project look like? And finally, speaking of the team, I think the presentation in this case is good, we have the names and a small resume of each of the members involved, so that we can get to know them better and get a sense of what they've done so far, professionally. It is also positive how the bidder attaches their linkedin profile, because that way we have proof of what is said. It would also be nice if they better defined who would do what in the project - the roles are not very clear. So the script is present but superficial; as well as the budget explanation; the team presentation is the most complete part of the feasibility, but it's not perfect either. \n",

      "I think we already have the basis for what is needed to audit this proposal, and the only thing that remains pending is how this information would reach the Cardano community. Regarding process monitoring, all the indicators suggested by the proponent are great, they are simple and direct ways to understand if the partial results were in fact obtained. Other than that, I suggest that they also do an overview of how the team worked that month, if, in addition to these things were achieved, the process to achieve them was developed in the right way. This report can be organized and made available together with the indicatives cited by the proponent, through any of the various means of communication of the Cardano community (or by telegram, discord, email, etc.). And regarding the final results, I would really like to congratulate the proponent and his team, as they have a very complete look at the final panorama, exploring the qualitative rather than the quantitative characteristics to be obtained. It is extremely relevant that this is done, as it generates a more human and not just numerical analysis. The final objectives are quite clear and, when seen, have a real and positive impact for Ghana, namely: to facilitate the population to find professionals suitable for the type of service they wish to perform, to promote an increase in the income of repairmen, they will have more customers and services through this platform that would facilitate the contact between the parties and the reduction of electronic waste. So what I suggest again is that the proponents find a simple and complete way to collect such data and bring it to the Cardano community, in my understanding this can be done through, first, an internal research among them: “ we will understand if all this was achieved and how, and we will collect data to prove it”. And then, they could create a presentation through illustrated slides, containing testimonials from repairmen, customers, data that indicate the decrease in electronic waste in the country, graphs that demonstrate the growth in the number of transactions on Cardano's blockchain from this project. and etc. All this could be presented to the community during some Town Hall, for example. In short, I think auditability is very good, just clarify how the information collected would be presented to the rest of the members of our ecosystem. \n",

      "This proposal can be summarized in the following sentence, the proponents want to carry out the intelligent intelligence program us can release a new set of administrative tasks domain tools. From the description of the proposal on the website that is attached in the part of “Website/GitHu repository (if relevant)” there is a little of the performance of the DLT360 group. It is a kind of technology, in which a group of professionals gives advice and directions to companies thinking about blockchain consulting. As far as this group is able to understand, the objective of all projects is to be well developed by third parties, to be planned at Cardano in a safe and planned way; in short, that companies understand and choose to use Cardano technologies in others and blockchain technologies (and also start to decentralize their actions). That is, the group that is, that is, what is important for the ecosystem, for what they are not important yet for the ecosystem, for what they are not important to expand. What I think could have been better explained in the impact part of the proposal is 1) what experts do that all users understand, especially those who are not in the domain area. These principles will improve the general understanding, proposed so that they would also act on knowledge. We are here that they would be responsible for administrative activities. What for exemple? And since they are working for this company, which domain experts would they improve on which projects? I think the situation faced today lacked a clearer explanation. It's just that domain experts aren't being as productive. For example, the situation could be better explained like this: specialist X stopped performing a task because he needed to do a task Z, which would be easily solved by an intern. I think that way, we would better understand the optimization that is discussed here. Therefore, I will give it 4 stars for the impact, the company DLT36 is fundamental for the expansion of the card and this proposal will contribute to the improvement of its works, but it would need more explanation on how, more details for the practice. \n",

      "Proponents argue that “since most of our activities are highly interconnected, we see overlapping and specific elements when we look at the business model canvas on a project-by-project basis”. In doing so, they provide us with two aspects of the script, the generic and the specific elements. In the generics, activities that encompass several of your projects are explained, while what we should focus on for this project are the specific elements. They are described from topic 6, participation in biweekly meetings (...), auxiliary or core team and domain specialist (...) and etc. All activities are planned to last a semester together, and are presented clearly but succinctly. In my view, this roadmap is ok, it allows us to have an overview of what would happen in the case of funding the proposal. But the roadmap could be better detailed, if, instead of informing that all activities would last 6 months, the proponents indicated how long each one would take to carry out; whether some of them could happen in parallel; if they had provided more details about each, such as who would work and how it would be done. For example in the following activity “assist or core team and domain experts with general back-office tasks”: what would these general tasks be? Talking now about the budget, 10 thousand dollars are requested which from what I understand would be divided into two parts: the payment of the interns and the general management of projects/HR/etc. I thought this part is very clear, we were able to understand well how the money would be used, because in the case of this proposal this division is not at all complex. I found the pay of 20 dollars per hour quite fair for an internship, regarding the management part I think I could have been told how many hours it would last as well. We don't know how to calculate the hourly rate in this case, although the amount is quite low, so in reality it may not be asking for a payment directly to the company's professionals, but for something else (in this case, a little confusion was generated, I would like to know how the $400 would be used more accurately). Speaking now of the team, we are introduced to the pair of professionals who would be responsible for this project. Little information is given about them, just what professional area they work in and also their linkedin profiles. As much as a trust is passed automatically at the moment that composes the DLT360 team (because of the projects they have already delivered and those that are in progress), it would be great if a small resume about each was made available in the proposal. So I think the feasibility is good, but it can still improve. We know basic information about the funding, the process and the professional duo involved. \n",

      "Proponents claim that they are already familiar with the Catalyst auditability process, as they have previously been funded. They make progress forms and also hold meetings with the IOG coordinators, as I understand it. I would like to know if, somehow, these forms would also be available for the Cardano community. In addition to the aforementioned KPIs, such as research progress, assignment completion, etc., do they talk a little about their work routines in these reports? In the case, if the planned activities were carried out at the right time, in the right way? How the interns were doing, if they faced any difficulties during the learning and work processes, how they were overcome and etc... That is, in addition to knowing the partial results, I would like to understand if these reports would also allow us to understand what would be behind them. Nor is it said how often these reports would be prepared and released; This is important information in my opinion. So I think the auditability of progress is not bad, but it could be more closely monitored. Talking now about the final results, the same KPIs are used, now conclusively. It is positive how they are qualitative and quantitative, not limited only in number as most audits do. I believe that the last two KPIs are the most important and, in my opinion, both deserve special attention: the feedback from the interns and the DLT360 team; How will we know about this feedback? What will he make up? It would be necessary for a more complete final report to be presented, or for this team to participate in a town hall (1 professional and 1 intern would be enough), so that they could present this information in more detail. Which projects were optimized and how, through the work of interns; how this was clearly reflected in the Cardano ecosystem and so on. In general, the auditability is good, but like the two previous topics, some points could be better explored to make it ideal. \n",

      "This proposal is very important for maintaining the quality of collective governance of the Cardano ecosystem. As I understand it, there is a group called Catalyst Circle that carries out various activities, such as recording meetings relevant to our community members, documenting them, ensuring that these videos receive a high number of views and in the future (if this proposal is funded ) they will translate all this content into Spanish, so that the Latin American (outside Brazil) and Spanish community can more easily follow the content in question. A phrase that can very well summarize the activities of this group is to promote the “governance, oversight, support for distributed decision-making” of the Cardano community. According to the proponents, the Catalyst coordination process will be passed on to the community in the future (currently this is done by the IOG coordinators); this makes it even more necessary that we have an internal organization, that we don't get lost in the various projects, processes, meetings, exchanges and all the activities that make up this complex ecosystem. I found it very positive how the authors of the proposal provided a brief explanation of what path they have taken so far as a group, explaining it through valid arguments (real life situations, such as increased views of their videos - around 300 views -, increase in the number of people voting and etc) as the group has gained visibility within the Cardano community. I also found it very important how they explained what activities would be developed from here, should funding be provided; and also how they were mature enough to identify possible challenges in this process, already outlining solutions. In other words, I think the proposal is extremely relevant and fits the challenge well, as it talks about distributed governance and that doesn't fit well with any other challenge of the present fund.

      "The proponents explain in a detailed and extensive way what would be done with this project, however, I think the roadmap is not so clear in the sense of being able to visualize the activities well. The activities carried out from May to July, during the Catalyst Circle 4 cycle, are listed in topics. Ideally, we would know what would happen in each month of this time interval; same thing for the period of Catalys Circle 5, from August to October. I think we managed to understand very well what would be done and in what way, just this visualization of temporality is not so safe, so I would say that the script is good, but it is not perfect. If we specified more precisely how long each activity would take, our understanding of the entire process would be more solid. The budget division, in my opinion, is ideal, because the total amount is divided into some parts and we have a good detail about each one of them, in a way that justifies the need for such investments. Let’s use as an example the excerpt “Transcript, summary and timestamps of Circle meetings: $663 per meeting x 16 Circle meetings (6 meetings per Circle, plus a retrospective and an onboarding meeting for each iteration) = $10,608”. It is not only stated that approximately US$10,000 would be needed to transcribe the meetings, but it is explained how much the transcript of each of them would cost, as well as the total number of meetings that would be held. As well as this, the other topics are explained with much specificity. Finally, speaking of the team, it is the duo Vanessa Cardui and Stephen Whitenstall. We know a lot of information about who they are, what their areas of professional practice are, examples of previous projects (in this case, total confidence is passed because this proposal is the continuation of a project that already exists, so we wouldn't be starting from scratch). We also know how they relate to Cardano (they are very active members of the community) and their linkedin profiles. That is, total belief in their ability to successfully develop the project (in this case, continue it) is passed on. So my only observation on feasibility would be to really specify the temporal notion a little more, other than that everything is perfect. \n",

      "This part of the proposal is impeccable, I think this project is highly auditable, even because of its nature of being a collective governance process, providing services directly to the Cardano community; that is, to verify if the desired partial results were being obtained, it is enough that we follow the deliveries made by the pair of proponents. However, they even go further, telling us KPIs that could be used to measure the success of progress, such as “numbers of meetings and events documented + unique views and impressions of meeting documentation + interactions, shares, likes, mentions and comments in media social media like Twitter, Discord, Telegram and etc”; and KPIs focused on bottom-line results: “increased number of people accessing documentation from Circle meetings + greater discussion in the wider Catalyst community of issues raised in Circle + greater awareness and understanding of Voltaire and distributed governance and etc”. I think my only suggestion here would be the following: in addition to understanding the results to be delivered in each phase of the project, it would be interesting to also know a little about what is behind it, that is, the pre-production of such deliveries, the tenderers' work routine. I think it would be great for them, at the end of each cycle of the Circle, to come up with a little explanation about it. However, I agree that what really matters are the deliveries, in this case, even more than what is behind it, since the main objective of this proposal is to keep the Cardano community together and well governed.

      "I found the proposal interesting, but at the same time the proposer could have provided more details about the Dapp he will develop. We know that it will be a space where “the members of the Innovatio community (Entrepreneurs and early-adopters) can have greater functionality and facilities when it comes to networking and using crowdsourcing tools within the community.” However, this explanation should have been more detailed. Who are the members of the Innovatio community? What exactly do they do in this community? How could they become active members in the Cardano ecosystem? It's not so clear either how this Dapp would work; what technologies from our blockchain would be used here, what way this project would increase the number of transactions minted in Cardano, of purchased and delegated Ada, CNFTs and etc. I think the research itself is also poorly explained, in the following excerpt “Proposal resources will be used for research and a model of web design, with member profiles, community users' Twitter-like feed posts, features to encourage search for interns, redirects to platforms like Gimbalabs or Cardano AIM Mentory Platform, etc”, we were able to understand where that money would go. But this is not the same as having a solid view on what kind of data would be collected in the research, how the team of professionals would get in touch with people (who would participate in the research), anyway, in general I think it is not as clear as this work would be done in practice. So I think the idea is a good one and it aligns with the goals of the challenge, theoretically, as it certainly seems to be an application that will help popularize the Cardano ecosystem; however, in a more pragmatic view, I could not understand the activities that are developed here so well. I would like it to be better explained both about the current Innovatio community and how this research would be done in practice. \n",

      "The proponent informs that in the case of funding “we will determine that the research manager prepare a series of research and community outreach measures”; however, once again I reinforce: it would be important for them to detail very well how each survey would be carried out, which questions would make up the whole, and so on. Regarding the activities that would lead to the realization of the project, we have a somewhat superficial information about what would be done, we are not given a temporal notion, during the explanation of the financing we are informed that the project would last 3 months, so it would be It is important to understand how much time within this interval each of these activities would take to develop. I think it would be interesting for the proponent to better detail the temporal division into weeks. In my opinion, it would be interesting to know what would be done each week, as this would give us a more complete view of the whole. Now, speaking of the budget, the asking price is low compared to most proposals, however, an application will not be developed, but a survey, so it is quite understandable why 5400 dollars were requested. The explanation of this funding is very superficial too, it is divided into two parts (Development of Graphic Mock-Ups for better understanding of the visual experience: $3,000 + Responsible for the construction of the research structure: 800 x 3 months = $ 2,400). It would be the salaries of the professionals involved, but I would like to know how much time they would dedicate to this project. In the three months, would they work every week of every month? How many hours per week? If we had this information, we would be able to ascertain whether the amount asked was fair or not. Now, speaking of the team, they say they have a PDF in which they attached the information of each team member, but in the attachments part of the proposal I didn't find any documents. We do have a link attached, but I also didn't find information aimed at each professional. I think it would be better if the proposer had attached this information to the proposal itself, it's okay if it gets too long. I would like to know the names and resumes of each person involved, so that the whole team can be trusted. Therefore, I think the feasibility is not bad, but there is still a lot to improve, especially on the part of the team, where in the end I couldn't find the information mentioned. \n",

      "The proponent determines 3 KPIs to analyze for progress development (Members responding to surveys related to the survey + Members actively participating in what content the WebApp should have + Number of people involved in the survey, separated by categories). For ultimate success, he says, you would need to assess whether “the DApp we designed to encourage networking and professional collaborations yields clear results in terms of member engagement intent.” In short, this is what we have of auditability. It's not bad, but it's superficial, once again. I would like monthly reports to be prepared at the end of each cycle of the total time, so that we could evaluate how the professionals involved worked and also the partial results, based on the KPIs provided. And at the end of it all, I agree that it's important that Dapp viability is the core metric, but I'd also like to know how all of this would benefit Cardano in an exact and measurable way. It would be necessary for all this information to reach our community members, one way or another; for example, through our Telegram group, or discord, in short, some direct and simple way for us to find out this information. Therefore, I think that this part of the proposal is also just average, and deserves to be better explored. \n",

      "The idea presented here is really innovative. It is about making scientific knowledge more democratic, through the minting of NFTs that would represent research, articles, in short, the contents of this universe. In this way, the control of distribution and commercialization of the same can be better controlled by the creators/authors of the research, as we know that nowadays many of these articles are registered on sites that for you to access, you have to pay a monthly fee or some fee to access them; and often the profits are not properly allocated to those who created such content. In this sense, minting on Cardano's blockchain is a very pertinent solution, since each product would be fully traceable, the author would have much more control over who could access it and under what conditions. The proponent explains that NFTs would belong to two groups: first, those “non-monetizable: open access scientific publications, especially those linked to an academic institution, may not, in principle, be a source of revenue for authors”. In this case, no monetary value would be charged, but a kind of reputation, that is, scientists would be recognized as relevant when indexing such documents. The second group would be the “monetizables: One of the objectives of this project is to allow the scientist to monetize their work” in which authors can monitor them in various ways, according to the proponent, either graphic abstracts or articles in itself, in short, several NFTs that can be purchased, generating significant income for their creators. It is also very interesting how other parts of the project would develop, for example, articles would be constantly monitored (at least in the initial phase of the application), there would be ways to “bet” on certain articles, in short, several different ways and activities that could be done within that application. Overall, this would all constitute a DAO, and there would be various forms (structures) in which these NFTs could be minted. My opinion is that the proposal is without a doubt of high value for our Cardano ecosystem, for the following facts 1) the problem situation is real and needs to be resolved, Cardano is a blockchain with intelligent and decentralized solutions that seem, by the way they are described , be very well used to help form solutions in this use case 2) the scientific community would benefit, since many times they even need to pay to publish their research, with this platform they would get recognition and a good profitability about their works 3) all the technologies that will be used here are explained in a solid way, everything that is pertinent to Cardano, demonstrating a lot of confidence in what will be done and consequently in the impacts that will be generated. This proposal is certainly in line with the objectives of the challenge and will help to popularize CNFTs and increase the volume of Ada. \n",

      "The script is ok, but it could be better. We know what would happen within 1, 3 and 6 months of project development. I think that the activities that will be carried out are informed in a very logical way, but it would be better if the time divisions were monthly, not quarterly. The way you're presenting the roadmap, we don't have a specific understanding of what would happen in the first month, the second month and so on. Regarding the level of detail of the activities, almost all the activities are very technical, so even if they were better broken down, I think most CAs would not understand the specifics of these jobs (for example, I'm not from the technology area, so I cannot understand 100% all the processes that would be developed and worked on). However, some less technical parts could be better specified. For example, in the second quarter of work, “Continuous discussions with potentially interested laboratories” would be held. How would these discussions be promoted, what would be brought up for debate, how would the project be presented in an understandable way to those who are not familiar with the cryptographic universe? How could we find out if after 6 months, in fact, 50 institutions would be associated here? I think some more detail could have been provided about some activities so that we could understand the whole more solidly. Moving on to the next topic of analysis, the budget, 80 thousand dollars are requested, the proponent claims that previously the hourly rates of the professionals involved were more affordable, until they realized the real specificity and complexity of the work, so this time a higher hourly rate will be charged. It is quite simple for us to understand how the funding would be used, as it would basically go to the salary of these professionals involved. We know the value of the work hours, how many hours they would work per week and the total time in months they would dedicate to application, so it is fully understood how that money would be used. About this part, I think we have the necessary level of specificity, there is no doubt. Finishing the topic of feasibility, the professionals involved are presented very succinctly, basically we know their names and professional functions. It worries me that only Albert Feghaly is related to our blockchain technologies (he knows plutus). I also think it would be necessary for them to have more information about who they are, such as previous jobs, their linkedin profiles and so on. As much as a link has been made available, where we can get to know them better, I think these descriptions could be attached to the proposal itself. In general, we do have a good viability, with few points to be improved, but in my opinion it still deserves the maximum score. \n",

      "In terms of progress, I believe that the proponent provides us with very good ways of tracking the progress of activities and small advances. He says that because the team establishes external partnerships, it's not that simple to promote live work, however, he seems genuinely concerned with keeping the Cardano community up to date on his achievements. According to the proponent, there would be weekly updates on a certain website (the website they use as a bridge to the Cardano community), and these would be backed up in a “very succinct way to allow for quick progress tracking and auditability.” ”. They will also make small articles about their “successes, struggles and evolution” available on another site; on top of that, public KPIs would be delivered monthly. I just have a few observations to make, as much as I think this part looks great. First, will the successes, struggles and evolution speak only about the partial results or also about the tasks performed so that these results are guaranteed? In other words, will we also be able to verify that the work routine of the project professionals is happening correctly? Were they respecting the amount of work hours that were agreed? In terms of KPIs, what would they be? It would be very important if the proponent had already clarified by now which metrics, both quantitative and qualitative, would be used to measure the gradual progress of this application. I think that this part is really very good, despite the doubts, because even in a vague way the proponent says what would be taken and how it would be taken to the Cardano community (except in the case of KPIs, they would be published on one of these sites that he attached to the proposal?). Finally, looking at the success scenario, I would say that this can be very well summarized by the excerpt “development and scaling of our OpenScience NFT Marketplace, where content creators (scientists and academics) will be able to share and monetize their work”. The proponent wants to create a way for scientists to guarantee a stable and fair financial return, as I understand it; even because we know that, unfortunately, academic and research areas are not valued as they should be in many places. I think the proponent lacked a little more attention to the direct consequences that this project would have for the Cardano ecosystem. Of course, the number of CNFTs in circulation would increase (since each document was a CNFT); but would other Cardano technologies also be supported? Could these scholars somehow become active members of our community, and how could this all be measured? I think auditability is good, but it could still be improved, especially in terms of the final results and how they would be perceived in the Cardano ecosystem. \n",

      "I thought this idea was really good, I think it could be a very interesting way to expand Cardano's technologies to a wider audience. It is about “providing a Cardano blockchain-based ticketing marketplace for live and virtual events powered by smart contracts.” The problem situation defined by the proponent is that buying and selling tickets online is full of very expensive fees (which is true, anyone who has ever bought tickets to a party or show on websites and apps knows what he is talking about). The solution would be to host this transaction on the Cardano blockchain, so that it is completely transparent, immutable, secure and above all cheaper. As I said, I think it could be an organic way of attracting new members to our community, because people would just be looking to do things they already do (buying tickets to various events online). They wouldn't come because of Cardano, but they would know Cardano automatically. Perhaps this will attract new active members to our community once people realize the advantages of transacting on the Cardano blockchain compared to other blockchains and even traditional transfers. The proponent also argues, through research, about the magnitude of the problem he intends to solve here, as is clear from the excerpts “entertainment is one of the largest and fastest growing sectors in the world (US$ 2.6 trillion by 2025)” and “estimated $15.9 billion ticket scalper market in 2020”. It's super positive how he gives sources of his research, several sites through which we can verify the said information. Throughout the description of the proposal, the proposer goes on to argue how this application would work and why Cardano is the most suitable blockchain to develop it; it also further explains what the benefits would be for all users involved, such as artists and end consumers. Therefore, I think the proposal's impact is excellent, we know exactly: what would be done; why it should be done; features about Dapp; how beneficial this would be to Cardano; what the experience of each type of user would be; etc. This proposal certainly aligns with the objectives of the challenge, which in short are to promote the adoption of Cardano through high-value and impact Dapps for our blockchain. \n",

      "The proponent states what would be done in months 1, 3, 6 and 12 of the project. Long explanations are provided, so that we are able to understand very specifically what would have to be done for the project to become a reality. I think that in terms of detailing the activities, this part is excellent, my only suggestion for the script part would be that it really breaks the total time into shorter intervals, for example in months. This would further increase the level of understanding of the process. However, I emphasize that this question is presented with a lot of specificity and satisfactory level of detail. Moving on to the next analysis topic, the budget is not very well explained, unfortunately. We know that the professionals hired will be “1 full stack web developer and 2 smart contract developers, plus a project manager” and that they would work on the project for a total time of 3 to 6 months, which may vary. I think the proposer should have been more specific here. How much will each professional involved earn? How many hours per week will they dedicate to the project? If the time varies from 3 to 6 months, it means that they can earn an “x” or “2x” value, as the same amount of money can be used for twice as long, for example. This raises a little concern for me, it would be more interesting if the proponent had defined a safer time for the development of the project, and stipulated the hourly value of each professional's work. That way, we would have a much more solid notion of whether the money asked is fair or very high. So, on that, I believe the proposal could be better. Finally, speaking of the team, I think that this part is also not so adequate, little information is provided about each of the professionals involved. Although they have provided their linkedin profiles, the ideal would be for them to better detail their resumes in the proposal itself, that is, previous experiences, whether projects developed within our ecosystem or not. I would say that there is a certain trust in them, due to their professional performances and linkedin profiles, but this trust would be intensified with a more extensive curriculum here. So I conclude that the feasibility is ok, but it can still improve. \n",

      "I think the bidder explains well what would be considered success in the 6 month period (\"shipping an initial version of the web client, deploying multiple iterations of the smart contracts on Cardano Testnet, and starting integration with the frontend of the client\" mobile for Android and iOS”) and 1 year (“successfully deploy our verified contracts on the Cardano mainnet, acquire at least 1 partnership with a venue or event organizer, and list tickets on sale for at least 1 pilot event”). However, I believe that 6 months and 1 year is too long for the Cardano community to be out of date on progress. I think it would be more appropriate for the author of the proposal to determine smaller goals, partial goals to be achieved monthly, for example. It would also be important to have an idea of ​​how the work routine of those involved would be, if all professionals would be fulfilling the promised tasks in the right way and within the agreed deadlines. I think the proponent will update the IOG coordinators at meetings that take place on a standard basis, but I would like him to make it clearer how members of the Cardano community could be privy to such information. Regarding the final results, we have very well defined the success scenario that would be “bringing a low-cost and frictionless experience to the market for the end user, allowing more people to enrich their lives with virtual and face-to-face experiences”. The proponent claims that this can be measured through the Dapp used in mobile apps; the main objective would be to deliver a finished version of this application and the secondary objective would be to establish a partnership with a Cardano project, already stronger within our community. Again, I believe we know very well what to audit, we have a great explanation of what would need to be achieved in order for us to consider success a reality. My suggestion is to make such information accessible to members of the Cardano community, in my view the only thing missing even in the auditability of this proposal is to explain how this bridge between the project and the community would be made.

      "This proposal is very useful and certainly achieves the objectives of the challenge, because it aims to create summaries of Catalyst proposals in video/audio format (maximum 2 minutes in length). With this, it is intended that such information be disseminated in a clearer and more democratic way, since the team intends to create these summaries in a more accessible way, so that both a lay public on the blockchain and experienced people have a good reach of the contents. created. This directly affects what we are looking for in the challenge as such media would be created in Japanese, thus favoring one of the countries located in the targeted geographic area. Certainly, with the realization of this project, people from the chosen location would have a better participation in Catalyst, as they would be aware of more proposals and thus improve their voting quality, as the authors themselves explain. One of the reasons why this project is necessary is the undeniable fact that the number of proposals has been growing exponentially with the passage of funds, making it very difficult for CAs, voters and members of the Cardano community to have time to follow all the news. in the various challenges.

Who would do this, and what criteria (they cite there are criteria) would be adopted? The review of audios and videos would be performed by whom? I felt a little lack of more detail regarding these things. However, they divide the phases well, according to the funds, they could also establish the duration of each task, that is, how long each specific thing would take to be performed. Regarding this part, I believe it is good, but with such improvements it would be even better. Talking about the budget division, it is very well explained. We know exactly how much money would be used in each fund and what it would cost how much, including the value of the working hours of the professionals involved. The calculations are done so that we have a solid idea of ​​what adds up to what results in the final amount, excluding any doubts about this part of the project. And finally, about the team involved, we also have a great amount of detail. We know the name of each team member, what they would do in the project and they attach links that prove some of the activities they have developed previously. In this way, total confidence is transmitted in the team to execute this project successfully - for me this is the best way to present the team, through proof of their CVs.

It is entirely possible to monitor the results based on the different goals they establish, both by the 3 indicators mentioned, which analyze the relationship of users with the videos (for example, how much time of video was watched and what is the time goal to be reached ). They also plan the number of proposals to be summarized and the number of new entries over time, giving us more information to track when it comes to results. About the process, it is also very possible to follow it, through the tasks that are described in the previous topic. In this way, we can not only see if the goals were achieved, but if what was promised to be done is being fulfilled at the right time, in the right way and by the intended people.

      "The proposal is very good and smart, addressing exactly what the challenge is looking for. It is a platform that, using Cardano technologies, will connect small farmers and businesspeople with creditors. This is important because many times micro entrepreneurs cannot earn enough profit to keep their business active and they need external financial investment, this is difficult to achieve anywhere in the world, especially in Africa, where the economy is still developing and I believe that the range of investors should not be so vast and accessible to ordinary people. This platform would include several things, the most interesting thing I found here was the process of preparing the person who will benefit (they will invest in it in some way). This person would be educated about entrepreneurship and blockchain, and would also go through a sort of filtering, which would indicate what type of lender would be best suited for them. I found it very useful and necessary on the part of the proponents to include this type of guidance, as they go beyond establishing the bridge between the entrepreneur and his financier. This project would certainly benefit the African continent, as it would help a fundamental part of its economy, agriculture, to develop, boosting small businesses. It would also help the local population (at first, this project would be developed in Kenya - another positive point in the proposal is that we are located in the country that would be the pioneer in this project, otherwise we would get a little lost in the giant dimensions of the continent). This would be done based on the instruction that would be passed, as the proponents speak, the teachings about entrepreneurship and also about what Cardano is, how our blockchain can be a gateway to different opportunities, either through direct funding on Catalyst or through education. (if people are interested in studying some of our applications, which could generate employment and income in the future). Therefore, I think it is a proposal that aligns very well with the objectives of the challenge, mutually benefiting the African continent and the Cardano ecosystem, through its dissemination and possible adoption by new people (perhaps the investors themselves too, other than agricultural professionals). With that, I will give a maximum score for impact, because I believe that with the correct orientation this project can generate great results. \n",

      "Unfortunately that part of the proposal left a lot to be desired compared to the impact. We know in a very basic way what is necessary to carry out the project, whether through information about the roadmap, team or budget. Starting with the script, there's actually no timeline here. What is revealed are all the activities to be done, and they are only mentioned, not explained individually. As a result, we were unable to solidly visualize the process. The total time interval required for the development of the project is also stated, but it is not possible to understand how long each part would last. To make the script better, it would be necessary for the proponents to change two things. First, detail each of the activities in greater detail. And then, situate them in the total space of time. How long each would last, in a matter of weeks, for example. Most proposals split the roadmap monthly, this is the minimum necessary to have a better understanding of the process. Regarding the budget, your explanation is also quite superficial. 75k USD is requested, quite a high amount. This money is divided into several parts, and even with many divisions, I did not find it possible to justify the amount requested. For example, 3k USD are requested to create content about cryptocurrencies. Who would raise them? What kind of content would it be, in video, text, pictures, a mixture of all these? Why does website creation cost 2k USD? And finally in relation to the team, the same thing happens: lack of detail. The names and positions of those involved are said, but many things need to be improved. At first, it should be established what relationship these people have with the Cardano ecosystem. Would they be experts, would they be active members of our community, how did they discover our blockchain and the type of work they currently do on it? What has been your journey so far at Cardano? Other than that, we would need to know what each one would do in the project, the previous job positions are told but not what roles they would perform in the present. It would be important that we also have some sort of proof of your CV, for example your linkedin profiles. From the way the project's feasibility is presented to us, I couldn't quite understand the process; justify the need for the 75k USD requested in the quotes; feel that the professionals that make up the team are technically prepared to successfully execute the project. \n",

      "Proponents indicate some ways to audit their project, in addition to some more humanitarian objectives that dialogue with their project (such as the fight against hunger, decent work, economic growth, etc.). I think the information present in the proposal about your audit is good but not enough to track the progress of the project in a total way, because the proposers focus more on results than on the process. As a result, the following metrics would be used: “creating a platform that adds tangible value to its stakeholders” + “creating a considerable and vibrant community of followers who read our posts and debate them”, in addition to the launch of the agribusiness financing platform, amount of blog posts about blockchain and the amount of followers they would acquire over time. I think they think very well about how to analyze the results both quantitatively (although I missed the following statistic - number of financing closed from the platform created); also in a qualitative way, as they seek to interfere with the way the population knows and relates to blockchain, which could generate a change in how Cardano is seen and people could start to get more involved with our ecosystem, whether by simply investing in Ada , or maybe studying our programming languages, participating in Catalyst and etc. I think there are many ways to measure the final impact of the project and proponents exploit them well. But they also need to think of ways to audit the process, that is, ways that would allow the community to monitor the execution of activities, partial results, and so on. I think this could be done, first of all, by establishing a detailed roadmap, a budget that involves dates and deadlines. In the background meetings could be held between team members and some active participants from the Cardano community, it would be even better if they were natives of Kenya itself. Through these meetings, the Cardano community would be aware of the progress of phases. In this way, auditability would cover all the fundamental parts of the project, in addition to the final results. So I'll give it 4 stars because I think the team covers the results very well but forgets about ways to measure progress. \n",

      "Unfortunately, this proposal has two clear problems. I think the idea is good but it already exists. We have the Catalyst School, which produces several workshops and has already posted on youtube several explanatory videos about Catalyst, with short duration and through images, that is, the strategies that the proponent decides to apply. Therefore, I don't see much logic in investing around 5k USD to produce content in which there are already other very similar ones on youtube. I believe that if this project were 100% focused on examples, it would really be something different, because there is not something like that in circulation yet. But from what I understand, the video production aims to be light and fun, conceptualizing everything that first involves Catalyst (and then moving on to other parts of the Cardano ecosystem) through illustrations and examples. I think it would be more interesting if it were like this: starting from the content that already exists, for example the videos from the Catalyst School, could be translated into Vietnamese, as the proponent says, and new content could also be recorded containing only examples. In that case, I think it would really be worth the funding. Another thing that I identified as a problem here is that the videos would be posted on youtube, and we already have a good base on this social network. I believe that it is the platform that has the most content related to Cardano, many channels (some more famous and others less so) focused on teachings about our blockchain, so the goals of this media challenge is precisely to take the production of media content to other types of platform , more traditional, such as TV and radio, with the aim of reaching a new type of audience. Therefore, I think it would be interesting to invest even more in youtube only if the generated content is very innovative, such as what I suggested using explanatory videos about Catalyst, translate them and extend them through examples. These are my observations on the impact of the proposal, in a nutshell, I don't think it's a bad idea at all, but I also don't think it's smart for the community to fund a project that generates content for which there are already others very similar in circulation. and on the platform where we are most popular. I will give it 3 stars because I think neutrality is my final opinion, I like the concept, but it can be adapted to our reality and become even more interesting, positive and impactful.\n",

      "The viability of the project is average, in my opinion. Starting with the script: we have a very detailed explanation of what it would take to build each video, such as narration, design, translation, brainstorming, etc. That is, we know of all the functions needed here. However, the pace of production of each video that gets a little confusing. The script in terms of time is quite superficial, for example in Q1 2022: would only 2 clips be made and would the team be founded? How long would each video take in total to be produced? And what is the posting interval between them? And how does the proponent plan to form this team? By what criteria will he select the team's professionals, in fact, how many people would they be and what role would each one have in the project? It would be important for the script to be revised and improved in two ways: 1) to better detail each task, explaining the details that involve it, such as that the questions I asked were all answered in the form of a complete explanation 2) to better situate the time, a quarter is a very long interval, it would be more appropriate if the tasks were organized monthly, that way we would have a much better idea of ​​how the process would develop in relation to deadlines. Regarding the budget, we know that the asking amount would be divided for the 12 clips, but if that's the case, that would be $433 per video, which is a bit expensive to see. Would any money go towards marketing? For me this is as important as producing the videos themselves, because it's not much use to produce content and not publicize it, so that it reaches as many people as possible. Within the 800 dollars that each video would cost, we know how the money would be distributed, but as we do not know how many people would make up this team, it is not possible to clearly understand who would receive how much. We don't know if a single person would perform each of these tasks or if the same person could be responsible for several of them. In other words, it is still a little difficult to understand the use of the financing, even though the 800 dollars have been well broken down. Now talking about the team, it's complex that we don't know, other than the proponent, who would work on this project. We don't know much about the proponent either, we know he has 10 years of experience with marketing and media production, but what jobs has he done before? How does he relate to the Cardano ecosystem, how can we be sure he has the knowledge to properly educate people in his videos about Catalyst? What is his role in our community, how long has he been here? Would he have any direct way to prove his resume, like a linkedin profile, for example? All this information should have been provided about him and each of the team members: a short resume of each, what they would do on the project, how they work in the Cardano community and a way to prove it all. \n",

      "The auditability suggested by the bidder is good, but it does not correspond to a complete monitoring of the bid. According to him, the success and progress of the idea would be measured directly by posting the videos on youtube. This is indeed the most logical way of measuring whether what was promised has been done, but we need to do a much deeper audit. Starting with the development process of the thing. We would need to be able to follow the entire path of the development of ideas, not just the final part. For this, it would be necessary for the script to be more detailed, in terms of better explaining each activity and also establishing deadlines to be met. With that, we would have more material to be monitored. It would also be necessary to establish a bridge between the proponent and his team and the Cardano community. The goal is to produce 12 videos, right? First, we would need to know how often they would be released. And maybe, schedule periodic meetings, at the end of the month, for example, to verify if the tasks of the month were accomplished, if the intended advances were reached, in other words, the partial results. For this, we would need to know well both the team and what should be done during the process. Now regarding the final results, monitoring if the videos were being posted is the most important statistic, but not the only one. Other things that we should monitor are mentioned by the proponents, such as: number of views with each video, number of subscribers to the channel, number of likes and comments, whether or not these values ​​are growing over time... It would also be very good establish a greater dialogue with subscribers, to see if they are becoming part of our community, if they are becoming CAs, proponents, creating digital wallets, acquiring Ada and CNFTs, etc. Therefore, I think it would be very good for the author to extend the follow-up, beyond the presence of the videos themselves and these numerical statistics. If these improvements were made, certainly the quality of the auditability of the proposal would be top marks. \n",

      "I liked the idea and I think it relates well to the goals of the challenge. It's about creating a space that is both a café and a learning center about Cardano at the same time. The intention is that people can go there to have a snack while, in a space separated by a glass wall (according to the proponents, to arouse curiosity), these learning sessions take place, which will be attended by two different parts: people quite beginners in the cryptographic world and those who wish to delve into the subject. I find it positive how proponents cite what subjects specifically will be covered in these classes, from a basic level with “things like wallets, staking/mining and all the things blockchain is being used for, like tracking logistics, voting, identity storage.” , file storage”; to a more advanced approach like “developing with Plutus, smart contracts, token economies, DAOS, building NFT campaigns, and more”. Another positive point of the proposal, in my opinion, is that we know where this space would be built, in the state of Arizona, in the United States. I think it makes a lot of sense to launch this project in a location where blockchain is already relatively well-known, because if the cafe opened in a country and city where people have very little information about it, I don't think it would generate any curiosity or interest. Unfortunately, most people still see the cryptographic world as just a way to get rich quick, when we know that it is not, especially in Cardano, where we have social and environmental goals to be achieved, in addition to the economic bias that is the basis of everything. . An observation that I would like to make is that it would be interesting for the proponents to mention what is the future expansion plan, that is, in which cities do they intend to open their franchises, if the initiative is successful? We know that the intention is to focus on the United States and Europe, but which cities? Another topic that could have been addressed at impact is who would be the partners and people who would teach these classes. As I understand it, the sessions would be weekly. But in this case, would it be a basic level class + an advanced class per week? Or just a basic class, and next week advanced? Details such as who will teach the classes, which faculties they intend to promote partnerships, how they will attract the target audience and which day of the week will be chosen for these classes to be held could be included. Furthermore, I think that the objective of the challenge is being well contemplated, to promote local hubs that facilitate the participation of diverse people (not just those in the technology field) and that dialogue with specific local characteristics. If the cafe is successful, I think their franchises could have the same basic idea and adapt to the characteristics of the local community in which they are launched. \n",

      "Regarding the roadmap, the proponents cite the objectives to be achieved in periods of 3, 6 and 12 months. In the first quarter, they expect trainers to be selected, the physical space to be in the negotiation process (from what I understand it will be leased), the first coffee cart is being built, etc. Notice that they explain what they want, but not how are they going to get it? We don't know, for example, through which selection process these coaches would be chosen, at which faculties they will establish contact, which Cardano specialists they intend to try to partner with... Regarding the coffee cart, we don't know how this would be built, what the elements necessary for this project to be completed; About the physical space, how would they get in touch with real estate agents? What approximate lease size are you looking for? I think the ideal would be for them to divide the activities monthly, not every 3/6 months, this is a very long time for us to understand exactly the process that will be developed. If the activity division were monthly and we knew more details about each one of them, the understanding of the process would be better contemplated. In the completed milestones part, we see that the main author of the idea has already started to put into practice what he wants to accomplish, and has already achieved many milestones. This conveys a lot of confidence about his involvement in the whole process. Now, in relation to the budget, around 38 thousand dollars are requested, it is a high amount, but the project involves many things and, in fact, many expenses, so I don't think it's an amount that is incompatible with what is proposed. However, this part of the proposal is a bit confusing. During the financial breakdown, the author of the idea cites various amounts and expenses that exceed $40,000. In this case, the proponent claims that he is investing his own savings in the project. Y value would be necessary for maintenance of the physical space, being divided into several parts such as rent, electrical part, ventilation and etc. In this way, it is quite understandable how much the project would cost and why. Finally, analyzing the team part, this part of the proposal is quite adequate, we know the names and main roles of the team members, as well as we have a link (either linkedin or github) where we can see the work they develop in practice. I think the detailing about their resumes could be more intense, but the way it is, it already conveys a lot of confidence. It is extremely important that they have partnerships with teams already consolidated in the Cardano ecosystem, such as the Catalyst School group. So, in terms of feasibility, the improvement I can suggest is more restricted to the roadmap. \n",

      "I really liked the auditability of this project, because I feel that the author is not only concerned with informing what the goal is, but also why that is the goal (there are several related goals). It breaks auditability down nicely into the two necessary parts, project progress and end results. The specific goals of progress, such as “portfolios created, sustainability, conversion rate and etc” are very well argued, as I said, we understand why this is important and how we can see if these goals have been achieved or not. My suggestions for this part of auditability are: could the author of the idea clarify how these objectives will be taken to the Cardano community, that is, how will the information collected reach everyone's knowledge? In my view, it would be important for him to make an overview, at least monthly, where all the necessary information would be gathered and forwarded directly and easily to the Cardano community. The author seems to be a well placed person in our community, so he is definitely in our discord, telegram and etc groups, where this report could be published. Now in relation to the final results, I think that the author is very aware of where he wants to go and where he will walk the path to it, but I think that it is also necessary to situate the Cardano community in a more direct way. How can we, people who live so far away from the café, know how this experience is developing in practice? In my view, it would be very interesting for the author to produce a short video, where he, his team, some teachers, some students, clients and anyone who was captive with the project would report how everything developed and what the current scenario is. If the objectives mentioned in the 3, 6 and 12 month roadmap were achieved, if the local community really got more involved with Cardano, if new wallets were in fact created, if young people were interested in learning and investing in our blockchain, who knows if local designers were interested in participating in the construction of our Dapps... Anyway, how was the process and the final results. This video would be great to play in Town Hall and maybe it could even be released in the audiovisual challenge in traditional media, for example. \n",

      "The proposal is very good and certainly aligns with the objectives of the challenge. Here, our intention is to disseminate knowledge about the Cardano ecosystem to more specific audiences, respecting its characteristics and particularities. The idea is to teach the elderly about our blockchain, in a way that is more adapted to their learning process, as certainly the explanations provided for a young person who is already familiar with technology and an older person who has never been in contact with blockchain are very different. . I found it extremely positive how the proponent, in addition to explaining what he would do, gives a lot of details about how it would be done. How can we present knowledge about Cardano to this target audience? A whole scheme is outlined, in which some steps would be taken: first, a study would be carried out on the way in which the elderly learn. Second, the content itself would be developed, following the principles researched in the initial phase of the project. Afterwards, such contents would be disseminated, I think it would be interesting if, in addition to social networks and institutions that target the elderly, alternative means of communication were also adopted, such as: a survey could be carried out on the main radio stations that the elderly listen, and during the programmes, something about Cardano could also be included. But this is just a suggestion, as the proponent already demonstrates that it has several options on how to disseminate the contents generated here. It is also very good that the proponent has already provided the KPIs since the impact analysis, as it demonstrates that he has precise goals, knows where he wants to go and that all the work will be based on these objectives. In other words, I totally believe in the potential of this proposal, I think it was described in a very rich way in detail, we know what the intention of creating content is, through which activities this will be developed and also what particular goals we seek to meet. I also think that the elderly are a very relevant audience for us, because it is not because they are more mature that they do not have the capacity to understand, learn and enter our community. Precisely, I think that they only need to be guided through specific approaches, as is suggested here. \n",

      "The feasibility of the proposal is good, but not ideal, in my view, there is a lack of detail both in the presentation of the script and in the explanation of the budget, and on the team, a certain trust is passed, but it is not very clear how these people relate to the Cardano ecosystem directly. However, let's go by parts. In relation to the script, we are shown which activities would be developed according to the passage of time. The way this is done, we have a good general understanding of things. We know what to expect and when. However, the activities themselves could have been better detailed. In the first month, for example, recording equipment, spaces on social media would be acquired and research would also be carried out regarding the best ways to teach the elderly. But what equipment would be purchased/leased? And about this research, how would it be done? I found the research to be one of the most interesting parts of the proposal as a whole, so I think more details should have been provided on this: what sources would they study from, what research methods would be used, who would be the people involved (all who were mentioned in the team presentation, or just some of them?). Likewise, the other activities could also be better described. Now talking about the budget, something similar happens, we can generally understand how the requested money would be used, but this understanding is not deep. For example: “sales and travel expenses $2,700”. What sales, what trips? It is not very clear what these parts would be, I wish there was more detail. Some topics are better explained than others, such as “content writing for recording segments”, as the total number of hours this activity would take to be developed is provided, so we know the value of the writers' work hours. Finally, as far as the team is concerned, we are introduced to the team (Tom Frey, Theresa K and Kevin Burke). Their areas of expertise are explained, however, it is not clear, as I said at the beginning of this topic, how they relate to Cardano. Their linkedin profiles are also not attached, where we could have more practical examples of their past experiences. Therefore, I think the project's feasibility is good, but it can still improve. \n",

      "The auditability of the project is good, as we know in what ways we could monitor both the process and the final results of this proposal. Regarding the process, I believe that this part is perfect, as the proponent states that a task flowchart will be created that will be available in the Miro tool; this tool is very interesting because it allows videos, links, images, drawings and texts to be posted. That is, we would be able to follow in many ways how the stages of the project would be developing. It is also positive how the proponent places us in relation to the frequency in which this flowchart would be updated: weekly. Therefore, in order for the progress of the stages to be audited, it is enough for us members of the Cardano community to log into Miro weekly to check the available updates. Regarding the auditability of the final scenario, I think that the audit quality drops a little, because we know what is wanted to achieve (launch of the C4S Cardano Hub for Seniors platform, FAQ and ELI65 library and its use (until the translation) by Seniors English speakers or other NEWBS who like the ELI65 system + animated content translated into different languages). However, I think it's not that simple to check out as diverse a range of information as it would be to follow the steps through the miro. I think the proponent could, together with his team, collect and summarize the main information that concerns the success scenario. Afterwards, all this could be organized in a slideshow (just an idea) that would be shared in synchronous moments with the community during Town Hall or, even, another option: the presentation could be created, the meeting would be held between the members of the team and recorded, and then the link could be made available so that the rest of us understand what this project actually generated as a result. In this way, I think we would be monitoring the end scenario as well as the gradual progress. \n",

      "The present challenge aims to fund proposals that at the same time benefit India and Cardano. This can be done through the education of technology professionals in the country, or working on behalf of projects being developed there that have something to do with our blockchain; it can also be done by increasing the level of education and generating employment for the local population. Regarding the benefit of Cardano, the intention is for our blockchain to expand in the region, reach more people from different layers, break barriers and become more democratic, that there is a growth in investment in Ada, creation of digital wallets and in general increment in transaction number on Cardano blockchain. With this, the proposal is directly aligned with these goals, because it intends to invest in start ups and teams of developers that work with Cardano. Proponents claim that there has been a recent boom in the country with regards to blockchain, but that this has mainly been aimed at other systems, and investment and work is needed for Cardano to occupy a place of visibility among the country's developer community. . From what I could conclude by reading this proposal, we already have fertile ground that needs to be sown, let's say, because India is a country with many students and professionals in the field of technology, but I believe that both because of the language barrier and because of the geographical distance one of the main pools, projects and investment center at Cardano (USA and Europe), this country has not had the necessary impetus to organically generate a community of professionals working on our blockchain. In this way, the proponents, who are developers and already have 3 proposals financed by Catalyst (it is very positive that they have attached their links, because we can see in practice what these ideas are), believe that with their knowledge and requested budget, a investment work in the creation of start ups that prepare these people (developers who could become key parts of our ecosystem), in the sense that in the future they can be proponents, specialize more and more on Cardano's technologies (whether through work practical or taking courses, such as the Plutus programming language). Therefore, I think that the impact of this proposal has the potential to be maximum, deserving 5 stars. \n",

      "The feasibility of the project is good in some parts and needs improvement in others, so I will make suggestions on how the shallower parts could be better, in my view. About the script, I found this part of the proposal very good, extremely detailed. We know in which months the project would take place and details about what the tasks in each of them would be like, as they are listed and explained in (I believe) chronological order. It would be even more interesting if the proponents organized these tasks within weeks, that way we would understand even more how things were being organized. I think some tasks could be more detailed. For example, when they say that in March there will be a campaign (I believe that it will be entirely online on social networks) promoting Cardano and job opportunities). I would like to understand how many days this would last, on which platforms this content would be released, if it would be in video, text or informative prints, if any digital marketing and design team would be behind this part of the proposal... In April some tasks could also be better clarified, such as “encouraging interns to participate in pioneering courses to develop essential skills”. How would these incentives be? Overall, I think the script is very good, but it could be better if it were even more temporally organized and some tasks were even more detailed and explained. Now about the budget, I think it's possible to understand why 30k was requested, but they don't establish a clear financial division. They explain which parts would cost so much, but in regards to that I think there could be more detail. For example, most of the amount would go towards the salary of the developer and his intern. Their work would last 6 months. But how many hours per week? If this were said, we would know the hourly value of each person's work. In total, how much of the 25k would go to the developer and how much would go to the intern? Would they work in parallel or would the intern do complementary tasks that would help the developer achieve his goals faster? The other 5k would go to a number of smaller expenses like HR, marketing, etc. But how much would go for each? And who are the people who would work on these, let's say, non-technical parts (at least in regards to blockchain)? What would your work routines be like? And finally, about the team, I think this part also leaves a little to be desired in terms of detail. We know there are two developers here (Advait Joglekar and Adnan Khan) and they are Catalyst winners. But it doesn't say a resume of what they've done so far, sure we have links to their winning proposals, but what work did they do in addition to that? How did they start working at Cardano? I would like more personal information about each, such as their linkedin profiles for example, so that we can get to know who they are, in addition to their funded projects. I also wanted to know who the marketing and HR people are, the intern and so on, in short: I wanted to get to know the team completely, with basic information about everyone. Therefore, feasibility can improve through a more detailed explanation of the budget and staff. \n",

      "I think the proponents have a good view of what it would be like to audit this proposal in relation to the results, as they provide us with quantitative (very satisfactory) and qualitative (which can be improved) indicators. In terms of numbers, we have many ways to measure whether the project has achieved what it wanted: “number of developers trained, number of new products or features developed on our dApps, number of interns on board, number of freshmen participating in pioneer programs of the IOHK through us” etc and etc. This would in fact be direct and statistical ways of demonstrating that the mission was actually accomplished. Now, looking at this in a more human way, the goal would be to create a “buzz” in the Indian developer community, in order for them to realize the employment opportunities at Cardano and how our blockchain is differentiated and has many advantages. It is intended that the professionals in question become active members of the community, either through Catalyst, as proponents, or by developing products (Dapps and etc) from scratch with our blockchain technologies. I think that in addition to HOW MANY developers were “converted” with this project, proponents should also analyze HOW. It would be interesting for them to establish a later contact with these professionals, in order to understand where to go, what they are doing, what they are working with, how they can bring a return on the investment made in them. I think this research should be done and the result taken to the rest of the Cardano community. Regarding the process, the proponents do not mention many ways to follow the daily development of their project, I think we should promote monthly meetings between the team and the community, in order to know how the delivery of partial results is going. In this way, I think that yes, it would be possible to fully audit the proposal, we just need to focus our attention not only on numbers and not only on the final result, but also on partial deliveries and what the developers would be working on after the project. \n",

      "The proposal is very good and perfectly aligns with the objectives of the challenges, although I would like more details regarding how the project would be put into practice. In this challenge, we seek to fund proposals that help expand the Cardano ecosystem to Africa. With this, we would benefit, as our blockchain would become popular, acquire more investors, more participants for Catalyst, perhaps qualified labor to integrate the teams of our catalyst projects, in short, we would grow in every way. And in relation to the African continent, it would also clearly benefit, as its inhabitants would be presented with a sea of ​​possibilities, both in terms of investment, employment and source of income (even if not fixed, what is it like to work being CA and VCA, or something more stable like being a designer or developer of some Dapp, for example). In the proposal in question, there is already a group that teaches about 3400 students, according to the proposer, about Cardano and its technologies. The idea here is summed up by the excerpt: “We want to hire 2 local people to help facilitate the delivery of our educational program to students and teachers in South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya and Morocco”. This certainly fits with our goals in this challenge. The issue is that some detail is lacking. What would be the subjects signed? How many classes would be taught? Would they be online, in person? What would be the language spoken? “Our biggest difficulty is finding an educator who doesn't just speak the necessary languages”; which? How would the target audience be captivated to participate in the project and keep attending the various classes? In short, a series of details remained pending, in my view, so that we could clearly understand what needed to be done. In summary, I believe in the potential of this idea and I think it will have a very positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem, mainly because the group is already active, it would not be a bet in the dark, let's say. These people have already been funded and are already producing knowledge about our blockchain for a wide audience, but seeing this does not exclude the need for us to have a very detailed explanation of how this project would develop in a practical way. Therefore, I will give it 4 stars, the note would be maximum if the explanations were more in-depth. \n",

      "There is no exact roadmap for the project. We know that 2 teachers will be hired who will extend the teachings on Cardnao to a specific target audience, but we don't know, for example: who these new team members would be, how many classes they would teach, as I said in impact, what the exact topics are addressed... I think it would be important to establish a detailed schedule with dates, specifying what would happen in these 2 months. We know that it takes two months because of the explanation of the salaries of professionals, so the most appropriate thing would be to explain what would happen weekly, for example: month 1, first week: hiring professionals + planning of classes + publicity of the course to be offered. Month 1, second week: first class taught, meeting with students, etc etc. In other words, we deeply understand what would happen and when, in addition to what tasks would be delegated to the new professionals involved and what would be under the responsibility of those who are already part of this team. Now in relation to the budget, they are asking for 3600 dollars, a very small amount compared to most proposals. I think this proposal is a fair investment, as it is not so complex (so many different actions will not be developed in parallel), so it is understandable that the cost is lower. The total amount is shared by the salary of the educators, each one receiving 900 dollars a month, a value well compatible with the market. I think it would be important to ask for an extra amount to be invested in marketing, because since the idea is to expand a course on Cardano, we need some advertising to do that, right? There's not even a budget for advertising, so I'm a little concerned about what this facet of the project would look like. Now in relation to the team, we are very well presented to those involved. We know the name of the professionals, what their main functions are, some examples of what they have done so far, as well as their profiles on social networks, where we can learn more about their background. In relation to this, I think the only thing that remained pending would be to present the professionals hired for the project, I know they will still be selected, but more confidence would be conveyed if this had already been included as well. So I think the feasibility is good as we don't have a detailed roadmap, but we do have a direct and satisfactory explanation of the budget and also the team members. To be perfect feasibility, I suggest that the proposer consider my suggestions and further detail this part of the proposal. \n",

      "The auditability of the project seems to be in compliance. Regarding the lawsuit, the proponent claims that a separate digital wallet will be created so that the budget usage is traceable. I thought this idea was very good and should be repeated in all proposals, because that is precisely why we work with blockchain: so that everything is done in the most transparent and decentralized way possible. The proponent claims that regular reports are made to Catalyst: this is really what I tend to suggest in my reviews, because it is through written documents that we can access information in a more direct, but synthesized and practical way. The question is, where would these reports be made available? How could the Cardano community see this? This question could be made clearer. With such a question answered, I think that the monitoring of partial results would already be very well done. Now talking about the main goals, I think the proponent suggests several things like: “each presentation has 50 students. Students are already qualified for the fit because they are in the field of informatics (developer) and or business and law, areas where the Cardano Ecosystem lacks talent\" and \"measure the number of engaged students, the number of references to Catalyst and we want to create new feedback loops to continue engaging our community by introducing innovative communication channels like Tiktok.” How would these students be monitored? An idea that came to me now is that it could be interesting to promote a general meeting, at the end of the project, where some more engaged students could participate and report directly to the Cardano community how their participation in the classes was, what they are doing now, in what way are getting involved in the ecosystem and so on. This part of measuring engagement in new media, such as tiktok, seems to me a little loose in the proposal. Who would? I think a social media role would suit this team well, as they intend to use social media to their advantage. In summary, I believe that the proponent has dedicated a good part of his explanations as alternatives to auditing his project, it is enough to establish a more direct bridge between the team, the data collected and the Cardano community. \n",

      "I don't think this proposal is so fruitful for the challenge. Our objective here is to finance projects that can benefit East Asian countries and their residents, generating employment opportunities in the technology field or even as CAs and vCAs by Catalyst, in other words, helping the inhabitants of the countries of this geographic region. to be able to work and earn an income through Cardano's opportunities; educate local populations about what blockchain is, what is the difference between ours and others, educate them about the advantages of buying and delegating Ada, in short, favoring them in different ways through the possibilities found in our community. This in alignment, of course, with the benefit of the Cardano ecosystem, after all we would be funding projects and we need to have some kind of return, which in this case is to popularize our blockchain in East Asia, make it grow there, so that new people join the community and investments increase. In this case, the present proposal even promises to popularize the teachings about Cardano through content released on instagram, but that would be for the Indonesian public, which is not in the geographic region that is the focus of the challenge. I also think that the asking value of 6k is a little high for what was promised, so that the marketing of this page is intensified. There is already a lot of content about Cardano, especially in English, on youtube, I confess that on instagram we don't have such a strong base, much less if it's for the Indonesian audience. In this sense, in fact, the proposal is innovative and important, as it would help bring content relevant to our ecosystem to a different audience, and one of the goals of our blockchain is to make it accessible to everyone, democratic, and undoubtedly the biggest barrier that we find is linguistics. Therefore, I think that if two things were different here, this proposal deserved a maximum grade: if the amount requested in the financing was more adequate for the activities developed (I say this based on many proposals that I evaluated, usually they all separate a part for marketing , but not as high as 6k); and if this instagram profile was aimed at a specific audience in East Asia, as the challenge aims, whether in Japan, China, etc. Therefore, I will give it 3 stars, reinforcing that the idea is good but does not align perfectly with the specific objectives of the challenge. \n",

Since the project will last a total of 4 months and all activities will revolve around marketing, it would be quite possible for the team to provide us with a more detailed schedule. It could be divided by months and those months into weeks, pointing out exactly what would happen in each week. This way, we would have a more solid view of the project development process. Some of the tasks highlighted here are quite abstract, like the first one, which is to improve the design. I see that the page already has a designer and that she will continue to work on the team during the project, but what exactly does she intend to change in her work so that the profile view is better? What kind of improvements does it aim to establish and in what ways can it achieve them? A certain task is “designing goodies”, what do you mean? Were they perhaps gifts given to followers in some sort of contest? In the second quarter they say that they will distribute some gifts like hats, t-shirts and etc, to spread our blockchain. But we don't know exactly where these gifts would be distributed, who would receive them and so on. Could it be the followers themselves? Would the gifts be sent by mail or does the team intend to have a face-to-face meeting with people? I would like more clarification on some of the tasks performed during the project, to improve the general understanding. Regarding the budget, it is very detailed, which is a positive point, although the amount asked in my opinion is high for the project, some parts of the payment could also be better explained, such as “others” (we could have an idea more specific than that part would be). And about the team, finally, we have 3 people involved, a designer, the project manager and a logistics and purchasing specialist. Apart from the case of the manager, it is not very clear if other people have a solid involvement with the Cardano ecosystem, the designer would be responsible for the concept and look of the profile, but does she have any other connection with Cardano outside of this work on instagram? Does she actively work in the community? And about the purchasing and logistics specialist, it is not said at any time what his connection to our blockchain is. About this part, so I think there could be more clarity on this point and also a more detailed curriculum of the entire team, with the aim of increasing our confidence in their preparations to make the project work, in addition to their linkedin profiles, if any. \n",

      "In my opinion, the auditability of this proposal is possible but not ideal. I say this because the team provides us with mostly numerical indicators to monitor the success of the project (number of new followers, number of new people on Telegram and increase in follower engagement). These are clear ways to see if the team's social media growth is succeeding, but we actually need to go further. I have two suggestions. In order to better understand the impact of the project, in addition to knowing how many more people are on social media, it would be interesting if we knew how they would be relating to the Cardano ecosystem. Did they start to acquire Ada, delegate them to some pool in our community? Have they become active participants in the sense of attending the various meetings of our community, such as the Town Halls? Do they now participate in Catalyst, are they aware of the existence of projects like the Catalys School that aim to help new members work with CAs, for example? It would be very positive for us to do a qualitative analysis, in addition to a quantitative one, of the new followers, so that we could more deeply measure the impact of this project on our blockchain. And in relation to the process, it is possible to monitor it properly, in my opinion, because there are two ways here: follow the Github that would be created and also if the tasks promised for each two months were being done on time and in the right way. It would be even better if the schedule was detailed in weeks and if the activities themselves were more broken down, as I explained in the analysis topic 2. However, I agree that, yes, there are possible ways to audit the process. So I'll give it 4 stars, since auditability can happen based on the information given, although it can be more efficient and detailed with some improvements. \n",

      "I think the proposal aligns well with the objectives of the challenge, the idea here is to translate content relevant to the Cardano ecosystem into the Bengali language, spoken in India. The proponent claims that in this region there are many people working in the area of ​​technology, and, at the same time, little content about Cardano in the local language. That is, everything fits. What we are looking for in this challenge is to favor India and Cardano at the same time. India, in the sense that we can take the opportunities of our ecosystem there, through courses brought in, content posted in the local language (as is the idea here), professionalization of people who work with blockchain, in general: creating opportunities for natives of the country can benefit from the employment positions generated by Cardano. Whether by participating as Catalyst project team members or even developing your own Dapps, acquiring Ada, learning to delegate, buying NFTs... In short, using our technologies to your advantage. And obviously, the Cardano ecosystem should benefit as well, one should increase the number of our currency in circulation, invest in minting active tokens on our blockchain, bring Cardano to a new audience that will popularize the blockchain and invest in it. The proposal meets these requirements exactly, because once content is available in the local language of that Indian state, it will be much easier for people there to get involved with Cardano. However, it would be interesting for the proponent to explain a little more what these contents would be, exactly, how it is intended to approach them, how they will be passed on and so on. The issue of themes is not clarified either here or in terms of feasibility, I think it would be an essential factor for us to fully understand what is being promised here. Therefore, I will give it 4, because I believe in the idea and in its potential, but there was a lack of detail to understand how all this will be generated and passed on. \n",

      "At first I didn't understand one thing. The proponent says that the intention is to release videos daily, right? And that when launched, the channel would already have 20 videos. If over 3 months (approximately 90 days) this goal was maintained, the minimum available videos should be 20 + 90 = 110... right? Because he states the daily goal and then immediately says that with 3 months the goal is to have 30 to 60 videos on the channel. Anyway, I was confused. From what he says, pre-existing videos will be translated. What videos are these? How could we access them? How can we buy its validity? We have 3 reliable sources: the IOHK channel, as well as the Emurgo and Cardano Foundation Youtube channel. But what about these other sources, how can we be sure about the veracity of the exploited content? Now talking about script, budget and team. The script is good, it makes it clear which activities would be done each month, it is said that the project would be completed in the third month of work, and because it is not such a complex proposal in the sense of having several different things happening at the same time, it is quite understandable how the proposal development process will take place through what is presented to us. Regarding the budget, the requested amount is 7100 USD. This funding is not explained so clearly, some things, like the price of the translation itself, are quite simple to understand, but others, like social media campaign and contingency fee, should be better explained. What would the marketing campaign be? Why would it cost 1500 dollars? Who would work on it, and doing what tasks? What is a contingency fee and why is it more expensive than the marketing campaign itself? I think the budget explanation could improve. And finally, speaking of the team, this part is excellent, almost perfect. We know the names of those involved and we have very extensive explanations about their previous experiences and they also attach their linkedin profiles, so that we can see even more details about their professional careers and verify the information that was said. I will give 4 because some improvements on the financial issue could be revised, so that we could understand more clearly how the requested money would be used. \n",

      "It bothers me that the proposer repeats some information in various topics of the proposal, such as metrics and KPIs. Finally, the auditability is average, on the positive side, I think the proponent provides us with a lot of material that can serve as a means of verifying whether what was promised is being fulfilled (that is, the development of the process) as well as the final results (the metrics and KPIs). However, what remains is to establish a bridge with the Cardano ecosystem, we would need to understand how our community members could audit the proposal in practice. Granted, the videos would be posted on the youtube channel and the translations on the forum, according to the proponents, but that would only allow us to track the partial results, the small goals that were achieved, and not the tasks behind it. According to the nature of the proposal (which is simpler), reports could be made at the end of each month, informing whether the activities planned for that period of time were actually carried out; whether there were problems that month; if all planned videos were posted (it would be great if the links were included in this report); anyway, if everything that was planned actually happened that month. The team could make these more complete reports available on the “Project Catalyst” Telegram channel, for example. And regarding the final results, a meeting could be held in Town Hall after the project is completed, in order to understand if the final results were achieved, showing data that proves this, if Bengali speakers are really participating in the Cardano ecosystem. after the availability of these translations; if so, in what way (it would be amazing if any of these natives could participate in the meeting as well). Anyway, I think the proponent provides us with material to be audited, but doesn't clarify how it would reach the community, so in general I think the auditability is just ok, with a lot to improve. \n",

      "This proposal is great and fits perfectly with what the challenge seeks. I researched here and saw that Hindi is a widely spoken language in India (70% of the natives speak the language), in that sense, the idea of ​​translating into Hindi several youtube videos from famous channels that talk about Cardano would break the language barrier (the biggest obstacle to democratizing Cardano) for a greater portion of the country's inhabitants. Our objective in this challenge is to work on the development of India, benefiting it, helping it to grow in economic, humanitarian or environmental aspects. In this case, the focus will be on benefiting people, so we are working on the humanitarian aspect. However, this will also reflect economically, because once the target audience of the translations knows Cardano, the job opportunities that our ecosystem offers, such as working as a CA or vCA on Catalyst, or even as a programmer, designer or other much needed roles in projects, will generate income for these people. With this, the objective of benefiting India will certainly be achieved, as its inhabitants will be facilitated to enter the community because, let's face it, most of us are confused by the Cardano ecosystem at first, it's a lot and there is no definitive and accessible guide for everyone in all languages. Therefore, translating into Hindi videos from the main channels that cover teachings about Cardano, such as the IOHK channel, the Emurgo channel and Cardano Foundation, will be a great way to facilitate the access of many Indians to the Cardano community. And with that, obviously the Cardano ecosystem will benefit, as the number of active participants in our community grows, consequently the investment in Ada also increases, new digital wallets are created, new students learn about our technologies and generate the potential for new professionals working on our blockchain, investors turn their attention to our blockchain, understanding its particularities and advantages... In short, the benefits for Cardano would be numerous, if the translations are all done properly and this content is widely disseminated, reaching the public's knowledge target, in addition to being mentored in addition to the presentation of the videos (maybe this is not the responsibility of this team, but it is a necessity). Something I would like to note is that here is the statement that it takes a long time to convert Ada to local currency, but I disagree, I do it for binance in a few minutes, I don't understand why this was put as a problem here. But anyway, on the impact, I agree that the proposal has the potential to bring profound benefits to both India and Cardano, fully achieving the objectives of the challenge. \n",

      "The team is presented in great detail, we know who the members of this team are very specifically. Included are their names and very sizable texts about their past experiences, where we can see who is involved with the Cardano ecosystem and who is not. For example, Dimitri Fernando is a person who seems to be quite experienced when it comes to our blockchain, and even if the ideal is for everyone to have some involvement with Cardano, a well-understood person already makes a difference. It's also positive how everyone's social network profiles are attached; these are always welcome to directly understand what has been done in their professional lives so far, as well as being ways to prove what has been said. I wish the roles of each one with this project, specifically, had been better defined, as we know what their area and experience are, but not what exact role they would play here. About the budget, I think this part is average, because the method of charging per words is not simple to be audited, for example. I don't think anyone would have time to count how many words were translated by video, in addition to being an impractical method of monitoring whether what was promised was fulfilled. Therefore, I think that other ways should be established, such as, for example, a definition of the hourly rate for translators. Apart from the price per translated word, the other expenses of this proposal could be better explained, what would the marketing campaign be like, why would it cost 1200 dollars? What is the contingency fee? Finally, speaking of the script, I think that the activities that would be developed each time are described in a very superficial way, we know that content will be generated and disseminated. But how will the team organize itself to make these translations? How many translators would there be, what would their work routines be like? Who would select the videos to be translated, and even what topics would be addressed, in what order and why? I think this part of the proposal needs a lot of depth, a weekly schedule of tasks to be accomplished, for example. So I can't say that feasibility is bad, as important information is provided, but we have things to improve here, without a doubt. \n",

      "The auditability suggested by the proponent is useful to objectively perceive whether the main goals have been achieved. Regarding the process, he suggests that the content posted on youtube be verified; regarding the final results, things would be perceived through numbers: number of subscribers to the channel, number of comments, number of hours watched... And, of course, the goal is for the Hindi-speaking community to have the possibility to learn about Cardano and become an active part of our community. I think it is already a satisfactory auditable proposal, but it could be better monitored. Some suggestions are that the team give feedback to the Cardano community at the end of each one, it doesn't need to be anything elaborate, a message that contains basic information about whether the work that was planned for that period of time was accomplished, links to the translated videos, the problem score, if any, during the content creation process... Finally, the most appropriate thing is that this general overview was summarized in a report that could be forwarded to some discord group in the Cardano community, for example, that focused on tracking proposals financed from that fund. And in relation to the final results, I think it would be interesting if a closer monitoring of the channel's subscribers was carried out, so that we would know, in addition to how many people are subscribed, who are those who actually watch the videos that are periodically released... their learning process is taking place, what they intend to do with the accompaniment acquired there and so on. I think this information should be collected by the project team, and taken directly to the community in a kind of final report, which clarifies how the project impacted the Hindi-speaking community in an exact way. Thus, I believe that we would have an even more defined notion of monitoring both the process and the final scenario. \n",

      "The proposal undoubtedly aligns with the objectives of the challenge, because it intends to expand a project that already exists (it has already been financed in several funds, including) that consists of teaching about Cardano to university students who are in the area of ​​technology, and with that them about the characteristics, needs, challenges and differentials of our blockchain (let's face it, it's a sea of ​​opportunity and what really needs to be taught/disclosed to as many young people interested in innovation). The project has been underway for some time and has already achieved some desired results, however, the language barrier is still present, hindering this knowledge to be disseminated to different audiences. That's where the proposal comes in, they intend to add two professionals to the current team, who speak Kannada and Tamil languages, with the goal of teaching Cardano to university students from Bangalore, Hyderabad and Pune. According to the proponent, these areas have many developers and student of computer science in India. In this way, the objectives of the challenge will certainly be achieved, of disseminating knowledge about the Cardano ecosystem to natives of India (so that it benefits them by generating opportunities for education and future employment) while, at the same time, our blockchain technologies become popular. and reach different groups of people, becoming more democratic. I believe it will be a challenge to find professionals who fit the vacancies, that is, who are aligned with the blockchain mission and speak the desired languages, but I believe that with effort and a lot of search this will be possible. And I think the proposal has everything to work out, because, as I said, it's an ongoing project, so we wouldn't be betting from scratch; the team has already shown preparation and determination to fulfill the mission of teaching about Cardano to young university students in the technology area (in my opinion, it is the most important audience to invest in. All people matter, but those who want to work with technology and want to have an innovative career are the key people for Cardano). Therefore, the impact of this proposal, in my view, is undoubtedly the maximum possible. One thing however I would have liked to have seen here: the proponent could have invested in a more detailed explanation of the progress of the project so far. I've already evaluated another proposal from them and remembered what it's about, but CAs who have never had contact with the team can get a little lost. \n",

      "The feasibility of the project is good, but it can still improve. Regarding the budget, I think it is very clear, we understand well how the requested money would be used, in fact it is a very simple budget that corresponds only to the salary of the new professionals that will be added to the team. I think the value is compatible with the market and it is very clear why they need this amount of funding, so I have no criticisms on this point. Now speaking of the team members, I think it's almost perfect. We know very well who the professionals involved are, their names, a small history of what they have done so far professionally, how they relate to this project and several ways to get in touch with them are also attached. We have their linkedin profiles, emails, phone numbers... In other words, lots and lots of ways to get in touch with them. This is extremely positive for me, as it demonstrates a lot of transparency and availability on the part of those involved. Now in relation to the students, I think there was a lack of detail. We know that would be “2 Students at the University of Ottawa School of Business”, but we don't have their basic information. We don't know their names, exactly what they study, in short, there is no clarity here about who they are. We know their roles in the project, but this is not possible to generate a complete understanding. Therefore, I would like to include information similar to that provided by the professionals involved, so that we could have an understanding of the team as a whole. Regarding the script, this part gets a little abstract. We know that the professionals to be hired will work for two months and that all knowledge about the project and Cardano will be passed on to them. But I would like a timeline that explains this whole process better. For example: in 2 months of work, the first would be to prepare the team, that is, the current professionals passing on the necessary knowledge to them? The second would be the classes themselves? They would teach remotely, right? Or maybe in person? How many classes would be taught? What is the specific content of each of them? A weekly schedule could be set up, allowing a full understanding of the process. Therefore, I think it is still a very viable proposal, but it could improve both in terms of providing this schedule (with dates included, preferably) and better detailing the students involved. \n",

      "In my opinion, it is a very auditable proposal. I think this is because the proponent suggests several ways to monitor both the process and the results of this project: through the provision of regular reports to Catalyst, being mandatory that the two new professionals participate at least in the final report (I would like to understand where these reports are released, whether they are in text or video form, for example); they guarantee that payments will be traceable, which creates a lot of confidence in this financial part of the project; they also have an estimated number of students to reach with this project extension (50) and so on. Some suggestions I can make are: they could establish mandatory feedback from students. From what I understand they would receive free classes, it could be a rule, that after the completion of the cycle the students would give a feedback saying how they are using the acquired knowledge, if they are participating in Catalyst, they decided to invest in Ada, they continued to study , specializing more and more... This would be a very simple way to measure success in a qualitative way. Another thing, I would like to understand how this new mode of dissemination (from what I understand is this) would be like on tiktok. How does the team intend to use the most popular social network of the moment to promote their project and our Cardano ecosystem? The proponent cites the difficulty of tracking the results by the students, if this mandatory survey were established, it would certainly help in this regard. Regarding the monitoring of the process, I think they have already ensured well how this monitoring would be done (through the reports). Another thing that I thought about here about how to monitor the results: the new teachers themselves could have a meeting with the community, in order to report how the experience was. Anyway, I think the proposal deserves maximum marks in terms of auditability because they showed a lot of concern in making this part of the project accessible, and also because they already have some experience in Catalyst so I suppose they already know how to give feedback in a safe for the community. \n",

      "The idea is good, but I don't think it fully meets the requirements of the challenge. I think that because, through reading the challenge, I understood that the main goal is to make the content related to the Cardano ecosystem expand to different media besides youtube, where we already have a good base of content and viewers. What is said here in this proposal is that a team, apparently quite diverse and prepared (they have a website where we can get to know them better, as I will mention in the analysis topic below, and we can prove that they already have experience in activities it proposes) will produce content in various forms of media about Cardano. However, where would this content be released, exactly? It is said that podcasts, videos in animation format (to facilitate the understanding of complex technical content) and educational articles for those who want to delve into the subjects would be produced (I didn't quite understand the format of these articles, would they be written texts?). These are certainly extremely valid formats and content, but I miss two things here. The first is, as I said, to understand where these contents would be released. In addition to youtube, how does this team intend to make these contents reach the public? After all, in this challenge, we want to get out of the bubble a little and reach a more traditional type of media (perhaps TV or radio), with the objective of reaching different types of audience as well. Another thing that aroused my reflection was which themes, precisely, would be addressed in each of these contents. Who would talk about what and in what way. Because, of course, podcasts are on the rise, but what kind of subject do they intend to talk about besides the most recurrent subjects, which they themselves mention (the unit price of Ada and speculation). I think that in order for it to be understood whether this proposal meets the challenge well and is something that we should certainly fund, it lacked a better explanation of what types of media the created content would be released by and exactly what subjects would be addressed (in addition to who would address which topics). \n",

      "The team provides a pretty satisfying breakdown of who they are. We know their names, what would be their roles in the project and a small text is also attached that exposes the history of those involved. It's good how they attach links, whether it's Anthony's youtube channel or Maksymilian's GitHub, that way we can have real proof of the work they say they do. Another very positive point is how we have several team members who have a lot of involvement and experiences with Cardano. Often the team is even technically prepared to perform the intended tasks, but does not have a strong connection with our blockchain, which in my view is essential. So, in terms of the team, everything is almost perfect. It would be more suitable if they already had all the members, for example, from what I understand they will still hire a video editor and an artist to do the animations, it would be better if they already had these people defined so that we had 100% confidence in the team, after all the animations are a fundamental part of the success of this project, as well as the editing of the videos. But I understand that it is not always possible to present a proposal with all team members defined; in that case, I suggest they introduce these new team members when they are hired. Regarding the explanation of financing: I found this part superficial. They ask for a total of 25k, and explain how much would go to each part. But it would be important for each part to be further explained. I'll cite an example: in marketing, partnership and promotions, they claim that 7k will be spent, but why? What kind of marketing campaign will they adopt, how will these 7k be employed? Who do they plan to partner with and what kind of promotions are they thinking of establishing, and what part of the 7k would these things use? Likewise, other expenses could also be better detailed. Finally, as far as the script is concerned, I also think it could have been better explained, they establish phases, but we don't know how long (in months or weeks) they would last, what month each would take place, who would work on which step. Although they explain the basic activities to be carried out, without placing us in what time and space (and who would do each task), it is not possible to fully understand the development of the project. In the refinement phase, they touch on a crucial point that, in my opinion, should be better explored: building bridges with other forms of media. This is what we are explicitly looking for in the challenge, so I would like to understand at what point in the project this would be done and what forms of media and partnerships they intend to contact. So my suggestions are to explain in more detail both the roadmap and the use of funding, the team presentation looks great. \n",

      "As with the budget explanation and the roadmap, auditability is present, but could be better detailed. Progress is forecast for 3 and 6 months, where it is succinctly explained what is expected for that time period. However, dividing the progress into two quarters seems to me a very long time, I would like to understand on a smaller scale what progress would be achieved. For example, such information could be given from months. In the first month, we expect this and that to be achieved. In the second month, we want this extra progress. And so on. That way, we would have a more solid view of what they are expecting. As in the script refinement phase, at a certain point in the auditability they claim that they will “partner and release with more traditional content partners”, reinforces the need for more information on this. It is necessary to know what forms of media these are and how they would be able to establish this bridge and arouse the interest of such traditional media to disseminate our contents related to the Cardano ecosystem. Regarding the final product, that is, what is expected as a success of this project, I believe that sufficient and satisfactory information has been established. We know what to expect, in terms of project growth, partnerships, public response through interaction, etc.; what we really need is to establish this follow-up. In this way, it would be interesting for the team itself to establish a follow-up, gathering data and information and presenting this to the rest of the community, either through participation in Town Hall, discord channels or specific virtual rooms that take place after the general community meeting.

      "This proposal is very interesting and aligns well with the objectives of this challenge, in addition to dialoguing with the challenge focused entirely on promoting the growth and adoption of Cardano in Africa. I thought this challenge that encourages creatives and artists to work in the Cardano ecosystem is essential, because I believe that there is no point in creating amazing technologies and having technically very qualified people working on our blockchain without this being able to reach the general public. And the media are diverse, as it is said in the description of the challenge, Cardano already has a good base of reach through youtube, but I believe that this platform reaches a more specific niche of the population, when we want to build something that goes beyond the bubble. Speaking directly about the project in question: first, I would like to comment that we need to analyze carefully, because funding of 75k is requested, which is a lot for a challenge that has 150k as a total fund to be invested. Secondly, speaking of the idea itself, I thought it was very good and the team was very smart. I think this is because they had the insight that it is necessary to create an interesting and engaging script, capable of transporting the audience to the narrative, and whose main objective would be to understand we should be interested in the Cardano ecosystem. The team promises to use narrative strategies, according to them, merging the rational and emotional areas of the audience in order to captivate them, so that they can come to the conclusion of how necessary and important Cardano is for the world from now on. I can speak with a little experience here because I studied Cinema and Audiovisual for two years, and in fact, there are some basic ways to make a movie successful: creating projection and identification is one of them, that is, the spectator “turns” the character. And in that case, the viewer can become a member of the ecosystem, whether through Catalyst, proposing or simply using Ada and other technologies present in the ecosystem. I found it interesting how the team justifies the difference between producing a feature film versus creating multiple individual social media posts. I really believe it is a good strategy based on good principles: the team expressed their awareness that not everyone will take the initiative to research what blockchain is, and bringing this information in a simple and understandable way is more than necessary. However, some issues (besides being a very high budget, compared to the money dedicated to the challenge) concern me here about the impact of this project. The team argues very well why it is positive to produce a feature film, but does not give detailed information about this film. We have a sort of synopsis, but that's it. It would be interesting for them, as an audiovisual team that is already active and that already has previous experience, to inform: whether or not there is a script; if there is, I'd like to see it. If there isn't a script, I would at least like a more extensive explanation, one that gives me an understanding of the narrative as a whole, not just the premise. What will happen in this movie? Which characters? What are the conflicts, and how would Cardano be inserted here? What's the climax? How would problem situations be resolved? How would the movie end, how would the established scenarios be presented and what would our characters end up with? I believe that in order to have a greater force in impact, it is not enough to know the intention (however excellent it is) of the team towards the feature film, but also to know everything about it. \n",

      "Unfortunately, I found several problems to be solved in this part of the proposal. Let's start with the plan. Here some phases are established, but they are quite superficial. For example, in pre-production, partnerships would be made with others (which others? I would like to understand who these people are they intend to contact). Meetings would be held (where, for what duration and for what purposes?). In phase two, it would be production of the film itself. I'm worried about the 2 months time, I think it's a very short time for a feature film and whose investment is so high, which doesn't mean it wouldn't be possible. But I would like in which months this would happen and what the shooting rates would be (how many days they would be, how many times a week, in which locations, etc.). It would also be necessary to understand what these flights are - who would be going from where, to where and why? And about these accommodations, where would they be? I think it would be more than necessary to make the shooting plan explicit. In other words, I would like to know what would happen on each recording day, which scenes would be made, which audiovisual professionals would be working on these parts, which actors (even, this part of the actors is quite vague, it would also be important for us to know the characters, their characteristics and which actor profile would be suitable to fit here). Without this filming plan, it is very difficult to understand how this phase two, the production of the film itself, would take place. Part 3, which is post production, is a job of editing, adjusting the color, sound and so on. This part does not need as much detail as the previous one, although it would be good that we had more explanations. And finally in part 4 I would like to understand the distribution plan: this is essential for the success of any audiovisual work, and can be decisive between the success and failure of the feature film. Where would this film be distributed, streaming services, movie theaters...? In which countries would the investment in distribution take place, how to make the film accessible to everyone and not just to those who have the purchasing power to go to the cinema or have a subscription to some streaming service? Regarding the explanation of the money requested in the financing, I also feel a lack of details here. For example, his team 20k for equipment, but we don't know what equipment would cost how much and why it would be needed. There are about 14k invested in flights, accommodation and meals for the team. I would like to know, as already mentioned, why these flights would take place, from where to where, how many people would the team be composed of (between 3 and 5, but if there are 3, would the same money be needed?). In this part: “Film (B-roll / Interviews) = $22,000”: What is this all about, exactly? It's not very clear to me. I also missed the money invested in marketing, distribution and paying actors. The financial breakdown needs to be revised, in my opinion. And finally, about the team, we barely know who they are, unfortunately, we are only told their names and roles to be performed. Some important information that was missing were: a kind of curriculum, in addition to the film “A Failed Artist”, which they have already produced, what other works have been developed throughout their careers? Very important point: how do these people relate to the Cardano ecosystem, how did they get to know our blockchain and how do they relate to it? Is there anyone who is quite knowledgeable on the subject, or would an outside person be hired to further explore and explain Cardano's technologies? In general: both the division of phases, the budget breakdown and the explanation of the team exist, but they are superficial, lacking details to have greater confidence here. \n",

      "I found this part of the proposal rather superficial and inaccurate. I say this because little information is provided on how the community could follow the development of this project. It is true that we can do this follow-up through the information provided in the project phases, but, as I said earlier, the detail in this part is also insufficient, which leads us to have little exact material to monitor. The team claims it will keep the community updated through postings on social networks such as Twitter. But I wonder: how often would these posts be made? And what happens to those (like me) who don't use this social network? I would like the team to make access to such information more plural. It would be interesting for them to prepare follow-up material that would be disseminated on several channels, not only on social networks. It is important that you participate in events in our Cardano community, for example. It would be interesting if, as I said about impact, the script and characters were already presented to us now, and not as a form of auditability. Auditability, in my view, is used to monitor whether the project is going well or not, and we don't know its most fundamental characteristics, you know? It would be positive for the team to provide us with more solid means of monitoring this project, the information given both in the detailing of the phases and the forms of auditability proposed here do not seem sufficient for us to carry out a solid monitoring of the project. In addition to the construction of the feature itself, it would be important for us to know what would be happening in the post-production process, that is: how would the film be distributed, if the expected audience is being reached, how is the audience's return, the acceptance of this feature beyond the audiovisual community and so on. With that, unfortunately I suggest that the team rethink the auditability, improving it through these suggestions or other ideas. \n",

      "I think this idea is very good, but at the same time risky. In short, it involves mobilizing 500 people in 8 African countries, all French speakers; these people would be from different branches, such as the press, developers, entrepreneurs, etc. thus mobilizing the French-speaking African population to integrate our community. If this works, surely the challenge objectives would be achieved. We know that the goal here is to promote projects that help both Africa and our blockchain. This proposal would certainly benefit the continent, since, with influential people from different fields knowing basic concepts of the cryptographic world, this knowledge could be spread to a good number of people. This would generate better education about Cardano, breaking down preconceptions such as “cryptocurrency is something to get rich quick”, since people would know about so many opportunities and projects that are born in our ecosystem, which has the greater truth to make the world a better place through of projects that dialogue with the humanitarian goals of the United Nations. And obviously this would have a clear reflection of the Cardano community if the number of Ada holders increases, as well as digital wallets, NFTs being minted on our blockchain, Dapps being developed and etc. The challenge here, as the authors themselves know, would be to captivate people to the point of being interested in what we have to say, teach and show about blockchain. As I mentioned, the prejudice on the subject is very high, one thing is to call Catalyst CAs to a workshop about our technologies, and another is to draw the attention of an influential journalist from country X, who already has his whole work and life routine solidly established, to stop his daily life to learn about something he may not trust. Proponents explain that they would circumvent this problem through the act of “identifying high-profile individuals in governments and cooperating with them to reach key people”. It seems like a good solution, but I would like to know more details on how this would be done. How do they intend to captivate these individuals in governments, by the way, who would these people be? Which countries are we talking about? The proponents cite the name of some cities in feasibility, but not all. Anyway, the idea is a lot and it can certainly be promising if it works, only this problem of “getting attention” is what occurs to me here. \n",

      "From the script provided, it seems to me that the whole process would take about a month and a half. I found this time too short for the goal they want to achieve, but let's go in parts. I think the division of tasks is good in the sense that they are divided into very exact time periods (this is rare, usually the proposals divide the time blocks by month, not giving an exact date for the start of the project and also for its I thought this was a positive point. But regarding the details of the activities, I believe that this part still leaves a little to be desired. In my view, each of them could be better explained. For example, during the \"registration and integration”, how would these two tasks be done? What would the application process be like, through which platform? How would they make the “call” to apply? Soon after, there would be the first training session for developers. in practice? Who would deliver these sessions, passing on knowledge? About the budget, I feel that there was also a lack of detail. The amount requested is compatible with the proposal, in my opinion, but it could have been better detailed in some s parts, especially the more expensive ones. For example, 5k is asked for “location”, but what justifies the need for this value? Would it be the rental of the physical spaces where the training sessions would take place? 3k is reserved for “others”, which for an amount of 15% is quite a lot. I would like at least an idea of ​​what these “others” could be. Anyway, as I exemplified, some parts of the monetary division could be better explained. About the team, this part was very complete, as you can see, needing little improvement to make it perfect. We know the names and a very detailed resume of the duo of professionals involved in the project, we know from their previous experiences, and I notice that both are well understood in blockchain, which reassures me a lot, as usually the proposals have only 1 more related member with Cardano. What I think could be added are still two simple things: 1) what role they would play directly in this project 2) their linkedin profiles, in order to see their work in practice. \n",

      "All auditability indicators suggested by bidders relate to results. I will suggest improvements. In my view, the proposal is satisfactorily auditable on the basis of the data provided, which are mostly numerical. It boils down to the number of training sessions, of people trained, of people indirectly affected (from what I could understand), number of posts on social media by people who were trained (about Cardano) and so on. They are indeed good ways to see objectively whether the intended goals have been achieved. However, it would also be interesting to do a more humanized individual follow-up of some selected ones, I don't know, maybe 5 people from each area, in order to understand just how many people were affected by the project, but also how. The team involved could establish a later contact asking for a few minutes of their attention to answer a report, it could even be in the form of google docs, with questions like “after the training, did you start investing in Ada?” or “how did you enter the world of blockchain?”, even “did you pass on the acquired knowledge to third parties?” and so on. In this way, we would have a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the process. However, what I always suggest in my evaluations is that we also have an understanding of the project development process, in addition to the final results. In other words, we understand: if the established phases were fulfilled within the deadline; whether the people they sought to train gave their opinion, were actually involved in the project; if there was any delay in the schedule, and if so, why; and that kind of thing. This would help to understand the partial results beyond the final ones. I believe this could be established by direct contact between the team and some members of the Cardano community, even better if they are natives of the countries in question. In other words, auditability is not bad, but it can improve both in terms of being more detailed and in analyzing not only the final product but also the process as a whole. \n",

      "The proposal relates perfectly to the objectives of the challenge, as it seeks to translate content related to Cardano into the Tamil language (spoken by around 68 million people in southern India, according to my research). In this aim, we seek to benefit both India and Cardano. And with this project, this would certainly be achieved, because: 1) by having such videos about Cardano translated into their native language, the inhabitants of South India would have an easy gateway to becoming members of the community. This can generate countless benefits for them, because with such primary teachings, people who work with technology can seek to study and deepen; for example, by participating in programs to become programmers in Plutus, the Cardano blockchain programming language used to make smart contracts. That way, they could work on one of the many Catalyst projects, where this type of manpower is sorely needed. Those who are not in the area can also work for Cardano, as other types of professionals are also required in the ecosystem, such as designers, advertisers who publicize funded projects, game narrators, etc. Or, even, the people who watch these videos become CAs and VCAs, project mentors and so on. The list of opportunities is extensive. Therefore, I believe that the proposal would benefit India to the full. And naturally, the Cardano ecosystem would also come to an advantage, since so many people would know more about our blockchain, maybe invest in it by buying and delegating Ada, CNFTs, the number of transactions on the blockchain could increase. With the popularization of Cardano, the general investment would probably grow. That is, it is a project that reaches both sides: the country of India and our blockchain. However, the problem I found here was the lack of specificity regarding the contents that will be addressed. We know that videos from famous youtube channels that talk about Cardano will be taken, but it is also said that videos from other places would be taken. Which? And what topics would be covered, in what order? All this information could be clearer. If this were explained, I believe I would give maximum marks for the impact of this proposal. \n",

      "We have a roadmap that explains what would happen in months 1, 2 and 3. However, from what is said the activities would be the tables (producing 360 minutes of video and publicizing this), but no details on the work routine. How would these videos be produced? Who would be responsible for each part? How long would the translation process take? How many videos per month? What would the marketing campaign look like? As important as producing the videos is knowing how they will reach the audience. Will the target audience be aware of these translations, and so, in fact, would the objectives that were planned be achieved? Therefore, the script is just a notion of what would happen, in my view, not being adequately detailed. It would be necessary to understand the routine of the professionals involved. Now speaking to them, this part of the proposal is very good. We know the names and a brief curriculum of each of them, that is, previous experiences, how they work in the ecosystem and so on. All social network links are provided, in this way, we can prove the information that is described. One suggestion I would like to make is: it would also be interesting if they defined more specifically who would do what in the project, what role they would have individually so that together they form a team. Finally, in relation to the budget, a total of 7100 dollars is requested, which in my opinion is a value quite compatible with the magnitude of the project. I think that the amount requested for translation is very fair, although it is difficult to audit whether 50 thousand words were translated per month. I think it would be better to measure this price based on the hour of work, because it is difficult to prove how many thousand words have been translated. Other parts of the budget like the social media campaign should have been better explained. We don't know, for example, how this campaign would take place. What would the advertising look like? Who would work on it? How much would your working hour be worth? Anyway, I don't think it's possible to justify very clearly how the requested funding would be used in this project, because we don't have the necessary details. Therefore, in my opinion, what has to improve in this part of the project is precisely the budget explanation, also a greater depth on the activities carried out monthly; and also, explain about the role that team members would play in the project. \n",

      "The author repeats here information already mentioned in other parts of the proposal. It provides many KPIs and goals to be achieved, such as: number of average views per video / number of watching hours / number of comments. However, I think there are still more accurate ways to audit this proposal. Let's start with the fact that the roadmap is not very detailed, so it is difficult for the community to monitor if the more specific activities are being done properly. Let's understand better: instead of just saying that 360 minutes of video would be produced, the bidder could explain what would be done each week; by whom; in what way; at what times. It is true that we are told how the Cardano community could monitor the partial results of the project, through the excerpt “All published video materials can be checked through the Youtube channels. We will publish transcriptions of each video in the Cardano Forum”. But that doesn't say about the tasks that would need to be carried out here, that would be behind and such goals. A weekly report could be produced that would raise if these tasks are done the right way, at the right times, and by the right people. This document could be sent on the telegram channel “Catalyst Project”, for example. Or even in other ways, it is enough that the actions are periodically monitored and that this survey reaches the Cardano community, in one way or another. Now speaking of the final results, we know several metrics that would be used to understand if the project achieved the desired results and if the main objective of making Cardano content accessible to Tamil speakers was achieved. However, as with the auditability of the process, how would the community have access to these final results? It is necessary that the author of the proposal and his team establish this bridge, and as it is a more detailed and extensive data collection, I think it would be interesting to create a visual document, to facilitate the understanding of the community. Or even a synchronous video meeting. In general, my opinion is that the proponent is concerned about outlining ways to audit the proposal, but does not realize that it is also important to make them easily accessible to the Cardano community, not only about the partial result but also about the processes. \n",

      "I found this idea really useful. Create a way for users to owe the reputation of entities (I believe both people and companies), in a decentralized way through the Cardano blockchain. In fact, there are already some types of sites where we can see the reputation of companies, such as specific sites for complaints, for example. But I don't think that compares to having some technology coined in blockchain, because it's much more secure, non-corruptible or tamper-proof. In this way, companies/people would not be able to change the data already registered, that is, it would be a more reliable source than a conventional website. This would certainly increase the number of transactions on the Cardano blockchain, thus achieving one of the specific goals of the challenge, while possibly attracting new users to our ecosystem, reaching more goals of the present challenge and also the specific challenge for this, present in the fund 8 , even though the author claims that the target audience is Cardano users themselves. I found this passage particularly interesting: “This is also a springboard for exploring the audibility of purpose-driven companies and entities.” In fact, it would be a very useful way of monitoring whether some projects/companies/public personalities are acting in accordance with their principles, this could even be useful for the auditability challenge present in fund 8. That is, it is a proposal that, when In my opinion, if well executed, it can have a positive impact not only on the challenges of Dapps but also on others of attracting new users to Cardano and improving the auditability of our projects. A constructive criticism: in the part of possible difficulties, the author says that carrying out this work can be complex at certain points and it would be necessary to seek support from third parties. It would be interesting if he were more specific, he says he would call a friend, but do we already have some potential partners here? This could also be important for us to understand if the author has networking. Other than that, I think the proposal has great chances of generating positive results and its impact is in line with the objectives of the challenge. \n",

      "The feasibility of the project is ok, having some parts better and others more basic. In the script part, the author states which tasks will be performed in order to develop his project as a whole, these tasks are detailed, so that there is an explanation, however basic, about each one of them. And these tasks are divided in time. With that, notion of how long each one would take to be developed, if they would happen in sequence or in parallel. Proposals generally establish phases. Ideally, we would know what would happen by breaking the timeline into months, and those months into weeks. However, I still think the script was constructed satisfactorily. Regarding the budget, I found this part quite succinct. There are 24k orders for design and engineering. But how so? How much would go to design, and how much to engineering? And within these two areas, what small costs would add up to result in this final amount? The asking value is high, we would need many details to convey confidence in the need and good use of this money. The salary values ​​of the team members are also said, but we do not know how many hours per week, for example, they would dedicate themselves to the project. And finally, when it comes to the team, we have a lot of detail about each of the project participants. About each participant, we know their professional background, what they have done so far, how their relationship with the Cardano ecosystem is, in addition to links through which we could prove the experience that is said, such as linkedin profiles (less for Christin Schmidt, unfortunately). One thing that came to my mind: who would be responsible for marketing? This part is essential for any project, and this one is even more so, because the idea is to build a network of trust, right? How is this possible without people knowing about the project?

How would the Cardano community be aware of the existence of such videos, how to follow them? The part I found most positive was the open Github, so the community could follow the more technical development of the project. I believe the authors have given enough details on how people could establish this direct and constant contact with the project. The success of the project is explained in a simple way, accessible to all audiences. The authors dedicate a part of the proposal to explain possible developments of their work, which is great, as they demonstrate confidence in our blockchain and in themselves. So, in my opinion, this part of the proposal is very good, it conveys a lot of confidence in how we could monitor both the progress of the development process and the final results, that is, it is a proposal that is self-audit. \n",

      "I thought the idea was interesting but I didn't understand why it is difficult for Africans to exchange Ada for local currency, as this can be easily done with binance, for example. It would be important for the proponent to better contextualize the problem, for us to know why this difficulty is being faced. Now, speaking of the application itself, I think that if Dapp is built and well implemented, the gains for the Cardano ecosystem will be high. If people (in this case, we already have a specific target audience, the inhabitants of the Democratic Republic of Congo) find it simpler to make this exchange, this could generate an increase in the adoption of Ada in the country, which would directly benefit the Cardano ecosystem. The idea of ​​the challenge is precisely to increase the adoption of our blockchain on the continent, as Africans often still face difficulties, often in terms of access to technology, which must be solved through innovative proposals. This project can also be very beneficial for local Africans, if it really makes them adopt our currency more and maybe, in an organic way, this makes them better involved with the technologies of our ecosystem, that is, they would enjoy the various advantages of Cardano.

There would be three months for the development of these activities, however, it would be positive for the author to better determine what would happen in each of these three months for the final goal of creating the portfolios to be completed. In this way, the rest of the script should also be detailed in this way. Regarding the budget, I think this part is well explained, as the bidder divides the total amount into several parts and details some of them very well, such as this one: “Development by the user with 5 Senior Mobile developers (IOS platform and Android at the same time) (6 hours per day due to $8 per hour)x5: 18720 USD”.

However, it is not determined how often these updates would be made, nor exactly what content would be added there. I think that the proponents should better detail how these updates would be made, if it would be possible for us to follow the development process in relation to the tasks as well, or only about the partial goals that are being achieved little by little. Regarding the success scenario, it is said that it would be measured by the launch of the first version of Dapp, however, I do not agree that this is enough to understand how the proposal impacted both Africa and the Cardano ecosystem. I would like a survey with users to be carried out, to understand if acceptance of Ada has really become a fact, if greater amounts of our currency are in circulation, if by chance these users also started to adopt different technologies (as if they started to use other Dapps, for example) from our ecosystem... Anyway, in a way they started to relate to Cardano from there. It would also be important to understand how this impacted their lives, if they felt more adept at participating in Catalyst activities, for example, as the payments are in Ada. If this is a reality, I believe that the Dapp in question would have indirectly helped in the income of those involved, since working as CA and vCA can be an income opportunity for those who cannot find employment in their areas, for example.

      "This proposal is about a more humane use of NFT, in short. The author claims that people involved in charitable or environmental causes generally do not have much involvement with the NFT market, or when this public buys various NFTs, there is no way to know exactly what the principles of the artists who produced them are. The idea here is to unite these worlds: from active tokens to people active in charitable movements, as I understand it. I found it very interesting how the author bets on the diversity of content that would be addressed in this market he intends to create: “creators from a wide range of aesthetic areas can create content. These include art, music, poetry, spoken word, dance and many other areas.” The author also separates the future market into blocks, which would group each of these categories. I believe this would be a very inviting gateway for artists and creatives, and let's be honest with you that as much as our community aims to be democratic and multifaceted, there's still more room here for tech people. In this way, I believe that this proposal can add a lot of value to the Cardano ecosystem, diversifying its audience, increasing the number of users on our blockchain (which would achieve the objectives of this challenge and also of the other challenge specifically focused on this), it would increase the number of NFTs minted in Cardanos and etc, that is, would benefit our ecosystem in many ways and achieve the general and specific objectives of the challenge. I would like to make an observation: the author claims that this NFT market would also give space to rural artists and artisans, that is, people who are not familiar with the Cardano ecosystem. How would this contact be established, how would this audience know and understand the technologies relevant to our blockchain? Apart from that doubt, I think the project has a lot of potential and could have a high impact for Cardano. \n",

However, other information is also included, such as more explanations about the application, how security would be, how it would be used for each type of user and etc. well because they were included in that part of the proposal. Perhaps it would be more interesting to put them into impact, because through them we learn more about the project and how it can impact the Cardano ecosystem. Apart from that observation, let's evaluate each of the three parts of feasibility. Script: I found it superficial. We know what will happen in months 1, 2 and 3, but the information given is not as in-depth, there is not as much detail. For example, it would be positive for each of these phases to be explained more extensively and completely, for the smaller activities necessary for each of the phases to be accomplished to be situated in time - for example, week 1: tasks x, y and z. Next, the author talks about the functional, security and performance requirements. I would like to understand in which months each of these requirements would be developed, for example, the information is a little loose. Plus point for the team when it comes to focusing on marketing. This is an essential part of the success of any and all Catalyst projects, but even more so for those looking to attract a new kind of audience, different from the “bubble” we are used to dealing with. It is very positive that this marketing plan is so well detailed in the proposal. It would be interesting to know how the partnerships would be made - in which phase, for example (I believe it would be in the third, in parallel with the marketing plan, but it would be important to be sure). About the budget: as with the team presentation, I think there could be more details. For example: 3 month Administration and Client Service 5000 USD. Why would that part cost that much? It would be positive if there was a deeper explanation, so that lay people, CAs and voters who are not so familiar with the activity of creating and deploying the marketplace in NFT would understand the need for this cost. And finally, the team is presented in a satisfactory way. We know who they are, what their functions are and a certain history that each of them has, along with links that can prove the information said, except for the case of D M Saman Chandana.

I would like a more detailed construction of what success would look like, in addition to numbers and the fact that the NFT market was successfully created by diversifying the categories of active tokens. When reading the possible challenges, I think they can be summed up in two parts: the pandemic getting worse (again) making the work of artisans difficult, and the variation in the price of Ada + slowness in converting it to local currency. I agree with the part of the pandemic, yes, if it gets worse, it will make it difficult for almost all our projects to progress, but as the author himself says, a way out is so a good number of artists and people involved, in case if some have problems like this bias the work does not “stand still”, roughly speaking. But in terms of Ada's volatility, it's basically the way the cryptographic world works, so I believe it's a characteristic that permeates all projects and can't be considered a particular problem here, you know? The issue of converting Ada to local currency does not seem to me at all a problem, this process is not slow, it is done through brokers (such as Binance, cited by the author) in a matter of minutes. So I didn't really understand why this was considered a problem. About monitoring the development of the project, this cannot be done so effectively since the phases were not so detailed. In summary, I think that auditability is present here, but it could be better explored, so that the Cardano community would have an easier time following the progress of the project, especially with regard to the process, in relation to what we know for track the results. Regarding the definition of success, I think this part is very detailed, it is possible for us to understand well the ideal scenario after the proposal is financed. That is, I found the feasibility good, needing just a few more things to improve. \n",

      "The impact is good, but there are problems here, so my opinion on this part of the proposal is neutral. As soon as I started reading this proposal I noticed a dissonance. In the title, it is said that there would be translations of content that addressed Cardano into Telugu, but during the impact, right at the beginning of the explanations, in the part of solutions to the problem, the proponent cites another language: “provide videos translated into Tamil educating the Tamil community in India and internationally about Cardano and its ecosystem (...)”. After all, in which language will the translations be generated? Perhaps the bidder got confused when writing the proposal, as, from what I can see, India contains several different languages ​​being spoken by its natives, and this same bidder has launched several proposals to translate some youtube videos into different of these languages. Anyway, I will consider that this proposal will work on top of the Telugu translations, but it would be important for the proposer to review this proposal and fix the error. Now talking about the impact of the proposal, I think the idea is good and it aligns well with the objectives of the challenge. There would be translations of videos from famous and important youtube channels that talk about Cardano, such as the “IOHK channel, as well as content from the Youtube channels of Emurgo and Cardano Foundation”. It would be important for us to know exactly what content would be published here, within the various options provided by these channels. I think the ideal for us to understand the impact in a specific way is to list how many videos would be translated and which ones, in order of release. Of course, they would start with more introductory topics such as what is blockchain, what are cryptocurrencies, what is Cardano and so on, and then move on to an in-depth approach to the topics. But to improve our understanding, the ideal would be that the proponent actually made available which videos would be translated, that he attached the respective links in the description of the impact. I would also like to know which other channels would be chosen for the videos to be translated, because this would increase confidence that the information provided would be factual, safe and correspond to the truth about how our ecosystem is constituted. In other words, we would have more confidence in what was to come. Ultimately, I think so, the proposal aligns with the goals of making Cardano more accessible to the inhabitants of India, as the language barrier would be broken down, and this would make it easier for them to become active members of the Cardano community, either through participation in Catalyst, working as programmers, designers or advertisers for any of our funded projects, etc. And, obviously, this would benefit the blockchain itself, as it would popularize it in India, causing the number of adherents and investors to grow as a whole. I think the things that need to be addressed are the confusion as to which language the translations will be made into and providing more detail on what exact subjects translated and where that content would be fetched from (apart from the cited channels). \n",

      "Starting with the script analysis, we are told what would happen in the first 3 months of the project. As I understand it, the project would have this duration as a total. I think the past information about the months is basically the same and is not properly fleshed out. In the first month, the channel would be launched, with translated and dubbed videos, resulting in a total duration of 360 minutes. And in the other two months, what would happen would be the continuation of content production, with the goal always around 360 minutes, as well as publicity campaigns on social networks. What would need to be done in my opinion, to improve this script, is that each month was divided into weeks and that we had an individual explanation of what would happen in each of them. Would it be necessary for the activities to be detailed in more depth, for example, how would the team be assembled? What would the work routine be like for the translations to be done? What would this social media outreach campaign look like? Which social networks would be focused, and why? And how would the content be transmitted? Would it be through illustrations, videos, texts? There is a lack of detail when it comes to understanding how everything will be organized. Now talking about the budget, the asking amount is 7100 dollars. The value of the translations themselves is calculated in words resulting in a total of 1200 dollars per month. I find it difficult to keep track of whether the promised amount of words has actually been translated, so in my opinion it would be better if this price was calculated according to the length of time. For example, 1 minute translated would be X value. That way, it would be much simpler for us, in the auditability part, to check if the requested value was used correctly. Other parts of the funding should also be better explained, in my opinion, such as the 1500,000 requests for campaigns on social media. We know that it is essential for any project to have strong publicity, but as I explained in the detailing part of the script, this campaign is not detailed, it is not explained, so we cannot justify whether the amount asked for this part is fair or not. All parts of the budget should be well argued. And finally, about the team, this part of the project is very good, a good detail is presented about each member of the team, we know their names, their professional resumes, whatever, what they have done so far, and we also have links to social networks through which we can verify the said information. Therefore, in terms of feasibility, only 1 of the three topics is satisfactorily detailed, so I suggest that the others be equally in-depth. \n",

      "The bidder provides a means of auditing the bid, both in terms of the process and the final results. As it is a project that lasts three months, my suggestion is that at the end of each month a final report is made available that contains links to all the videos that were translated and also a small summary of how the team worked in that period of time. : if everything that was planned was done, both in the production of translation and in the dissemination of the content, if something was pending for the next month, if any difficulties were faced, etc. I think that this way, we would have a more complete understanding of the development process, beyond the posting of the videos itself (which is the most important thing, of course, but not the only thing to follow during the 3 months). And in terms of the final results, I would like more qualitative data to be analyzed in addition to the numerical statistics provided by the proponent. It is extremely important that we know the number of followers on the channel, the number of hours viewed, etc., because these quantities will objectively demonstrate the scope of this project. But beyond that, we would need to understand if the people who watched the translated videos were understanding well, if they actually became active members of the community, if they created digital wallets, acquired Ada, etc. This data could be collected through a direct survey with the channel's consumers, and the results of this survey would need to be made known to the Cardano community. This bridge can be established in several different ways, such as through more written forms, or through a video meeting between the team and some channel subscribers, who feel engaged in helping to understand the impact of this project, this meeting could be done in some post Town Hall room, recorded and posted on their own channel, of course, if all participants allowed it. In summary, I think the auditability is good, but it can improve in some points, mainly due to a more humane approach to the final results. \n",

      "I found the idea to be very important, it is about establishing a group of workers who will meet with the aim of researching opportunities and features of Dapps to be developed in Cardano. The Research Guild group, according to the proponents, is focused on understanding how the market is currently and what the development forecasts for Cardano in 2022 are. that I understand) for the Cardano ecosystem. In fact, one of the obstacles in developing projects with our blockchain is the lack of solid understanding of the market situation and how Cardano can be differentiated from other blockchains; In other words, I think that having research that makes it clear and proven how to proceed in these situations will be extremely useful for Cardano and will certainly develop for a future that is more conducive to the development of quality Dapps that generate returns for our blockchain. Proponents also mention that a consultancy service could be provided in private homes, that is, groups that intend to propose on Catalyst or even those that are already funded but need help regarding the paths they will take in their work. I found this idea really very positive, fitting for sure with the objectives of the challenge. We want to somehow popularize Cardano, exponentially increase the adoption of our blockchain; this can be seen by the number of Dapps created, active community members added, amount of Ada and CNFT being acquired and traded... I think all these small goals will be achieved if this project succeeds, once with the best guidance (promoted through these surveys), Dapps projects will certainly improve quality; this quality will generate results, such as greater investment and adoption of our blockchain, which is still in the process of expansion. The proponents, throughout the impact, explain in detail how this project would be constituted, by which parts and what each one of them will generate for the total process, demonstrating a lot of mastery and clarity about the entire extension of the project and making its characteristics understood by the proposal readers. For these reasons, I believe that this proposal deserves the maximum score in impact, its premise is extremely useful for Cardano and it can achieve the specific objectives of this challenge. \n",

      "Regarding the roadmap, I think the information that is given is extremely rich and explains in an extensive and detailed way what would happen during the project development process. One observation I would like to make is: it would be a little simpler if the bidders had split the time more explicitly. They are concerned with placing the readers of the proposal on which parts will compose the project and which activities would be necessary for each phase (I will comment more on this shortly). Now, talking about the temporal notion, we are told first that the “start of the project” would be in “May (Q2 2022)”, and then that “it is estimated that a DApp Snapshot (20 page executive report) will take three months (full-time) to complete: starting in May (Q2 2022) and concluding in August (Q3 2022).” From my point of view, if the proponents had organized the script into months and within these spaces they had divided the explanations about the activities, the visualization of the process linearly would be simpler. Speaking now of the activities explained, in fact this part is perfect, we know that they would be divided into two main groups: “the construction of the Research Guild (20% of the treasury)” and the “custom guild reports (80% of the treasury) ”. Each of them is explained with extreme care, so that we have full understanding of what would be done and how. The requested budget of 34,200 dollars, in my opinion, is a very fair value for the dimension and complexity of this proposal, I think it will really generate great results for Cardano and deserves this funding. The explanations about the money are extremely satisfactory (congratulations to this team!); We know that you will be charged a base fee ($32.74 per hour), a researcher fee ($75.00 per hour), and a research assistant fee ($40.00 per hour). Despite not being a conventional currency division, I found it totally satisfying in terms of making us understand how the money will be used. Finally, speaking of the team members, we know that they are 3 professionals: Troy Egan, Mina Cu and Séverin Bonnet. Total confidence in the trio is conveyed, as we know their professional attributions (levels of education and current area), a small curriculum and also links to pages such as linkedin, where we can see in practice what they have done so far and we have proof as well as the information provided. In summary, the auditability of the project is very high. \n",

      "Progress measurement is impeccable, proponents state three ways in which this project will be monitored during its development process, these being the establishment of a set of KPIs; involvement with internal peer review processes to assess project deliverables and also involvement with a Catalyst community consultant review and audit. They state what the variable KPIs would be, in the part of “researcher identification and dissemination + researcher integration + management and support for research projects (...)”; and also the fixed KPIs on “creating bespoke research projects targeting Project Catalyst campaigns + creating custom research projects for Project Catalyst proponent collaborations + identifying guild members for research reports and peer review (.. .)”. They also tell you what the reporting objectives would be. That is, all the ways in which the project can be measured, analyzed and reformulated are explained, making it very clear to the Cardano Community what should be aimed at during the progress of the project phases. Turning now to the final results, they explain more comprehensively what would have to be achieved (without setting enumerated objectives, for example); but we are also told exactly what to expect, my suggestion here would be that the Cardano community could have a direct dialogue with the project team through some participation in Town Hall, or even after that; in it, proponents could make an overview of everything that was done and what direct impacts were observed in the development of Dapps projects, and how this, organically, contributed to the popularization of Cardano. I think that just like the other topics, the auditability is very accurate and gives us all the information we need safely. \n",

      "I was really confused by this proposal. What's the point here? Help increase the size and reach of this event, called BITCONF? At what point would this be beneficial for the Cardano ecosystem? In this challenge, we seek to fund projects that help bring knowledge about the Cardano ecosystem to specific communities, seeking to respect and dialogue with their cultural and linguistic characteristics. In this case, the community would be Brazilians already adept in the cryptographic world. I agree that in a way this could be considered with the hub. However, it is very abstract what content would be covered in this event. According to the proponent, “BITCONF - Brazilian Conference on Bitcoin, Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies - is the largest and most traditional cryptocurrency event in Brazil”; in this edition of the event, the objective would be to promote a debate on free software. Perhaps this is where the Cardano community fits in. But what worries me is that these people seem to be much more familiar with and adept at bitcoin than they are Ada. This event, at least appears to be more focused on this cryptocurrency and this blockchain - which does not say about our ecosystem itself. Therefore, I think that this proposal very partially meets the objectives of the challenge, it is certainly aimed at a specific audience, which has its own characteristics and even a certain history with this initiative, but it is not clear how all this relates to Cardano . We need to popularize our blockchain, make it better known, encourage people to create digital wallets, participate in Catalyst, study more about our specific technologies, the ways we work and understand the principles that govern our community. And none of that is clear in the case of this proposal. Therefore, I suggest that the proponent revises explanation of the impact, as the way it is presented, I am not sure that this event will especially benefit Cardano - it seems to me more like something that will promote the propagation of the cryptographic world, of blockchain technology, of how decentralization can be used in many cases - but if it focuses exactly on our ecosystem. Therefore, I will give a neutral note, unfortunately, if the understanding had been firmer, my position would probably be different. \n",

      "From what I understand, the event would be organized in a month, and with that the proponent details which activities would be developed each week. In this way, the script presented is quite satisfactory, allowing a very solid visualization of the process. As in the case of the script, the part dedicated to the budget explanation is very detailed, of the approximately 38 thousand dollars requested, we understand very well how they would be spent. The total amount is divided into smaller parts like grant, organization, marketing and promotion and etc. Each of these parts has small topics by which we can understand more specifically what the larger divisions are about. However, my suggestion is that within these parts, it could still be stated what would be spent for each of these topics. Let's use the marketing and promotion part as an example: within this part there would be expenses related to: graphic material about Cardano, portfolios, catalyst, promotion and dynamism campaigns, etc”. How much would each of these things cost? How much would go to portfolios, and how much to promotion campaigns? I think that if small values ​​were assigned to each of these topics, surely the budget understanding would be perfect. Finally, let's talk about the team, this is without a doubt the best part of feasibility; We know the names of each professional involved, their linkedin profiles and a long résumé about all of them. This curriculum explains what their areas of expertise are and also some previous experiences, as well as how these people relate to the Cardano ecosystem. This gives me a lot of confidence, because, as I mentioned in Impact, in that part of the proposal I thought it was not so clear how this event would directly benefit the Cardano ecosystem, but seeing that the team is engaged with our blockchain, this concern of sure out I decreased. In other words, by the information that is passed on to us, it is convey a lot of credibility and trust in this team. Really, my only suggestion to make the project's feasibility even better is that the budget division be even better explained. Other than that, I think it's a very well presented proposal in terms of script and team, with the financing being explained in an ok way, but not perfect. \n",

      "I like the auditability of this proposal, the proponents explain very well what is expected for the progress and the final results of the project, but I think we still have aspects to improve here. Starting with analyzing the monitoring of the project's development, we know that this progress will be measured based on the number of event participants, gifts distributed, creation of portfolios and other indicators. However, in addition to these goals, I would like to know, for example, how we could follow the pre-production work of the event? We know that this will last for 1 month, and we know which tasks must be performed on a weekly basis. With this, it is enough for one of the team's participants to carry out this weekly inspection and gather general information on how everyone would be working, possible delays and difficulties, if the expected achievements for each period of time were achieved, etc. Due to the nature of the proposal, as it is the preparation of an event, I think it would be more practical that a small report (even small, maybe 1 page would be enough) could be prepared and made available to the Cardano community through some discord room focused on monitor projects financed in fund 8, for example. In this way, we would know not only if the goals were achieved, but also if the tasks necessary for this were performed in the most adequate way. Regarding the final scenario, I think we would need to do both a quantitative and qualitative analysis, it would be interesting for some entrepreneurs, participants of the event, to give feedback to the organizers, who would inform them if they decided to work with Cardano's blockchain, acquire Ada, invest in any of our Dapps projects and etc. It would also be interesting to carry out a survey with the general public that participated in the event, not just entrepreneurs or people already in the cryptographic field. Have laypeople come to understand better about blockchain and specifically about Cardano? I would really like the proponents to establish this contact between the public and the Cardano community, and of course, inform us if the KPIs outlined were achievements. I think that the format of presentation of such data would be according to the preference of the team, an office document could be prepared, a video call could be held... if there was such a call, it would be great for some event participants, in addition to team, make a special appearance. This could happen during town hall, for example. Anyway, I think the auditability is good, but it can improve in some points to make it perfect. \n",

      "I thought this idea was great, it's about doing a kind of extension on the Atala Prism DIDs focused on travelers, their activities and needs. Data such as “official identity - passport and/or national identity information + health - allergies, disability and access requirements, smoking preferences, vaccination/COVID-19 testing status + demographics - age, sex, gender pronoun preferences, marital status, children, occupation + travel preferences - seat location, floor preference, type of trip (vacation, business), nutrition” will be included; that way, travelers won't have to provide the same information in a repetitive, time-consuming and impractical way. That is, this technology would be of great use for people who travel frequently and do not want to waste time with the constant supply of this data. The technology would also be useful for hospitality services, for example, as this data “will provide a variety of possible interactions for travel customers, where the data requested is limited to what is needed to complete the transaction and transparent to the traveller.” . This integration would also allow hotel staff to conveniently verify customer personal information, their documents, payment details, etc. I believe that for the aviation sector this would also be very useful, as passenger data would also be collected in a more practical and straightforward way. For Cardano, this project could be of high impact because it could make Atala Prism a format, as the proponent himself says, dominant in the travel sector, which currently represents 1 billion dollars (I believe annually), that is, reusable identification is investing in a strategic market that can give Cardano a lot of return, both financially and in terms of helping our blockchain become more popular and adopted. The proposal aligns well with the objectives of the challenge, as it will explicitly contribute to greater adoption of Atala Prism DIDs, through this extension project, let's say. This can even make new people arouse interest in our blockchain and seek to better understand the technologies relevant to it, perhaps even becoming active members of our community. Therefore, I think the proposal is very good and could generate great impacts for Cardano. \n",

      "In my opinion, the feasibility of the project is high. We know what would need to happen for the project to materialize (the tasks), and these are divided according to the months (in the deliverables part). That way, we have a great view of the process, knowing what would need to happen and in what timeframes, which will help us with auditability later on. My only suggestion is that the divisions be done monthly, so that the specificity in this part of the proposal would be further increased. Regarding the details of the activities themselves, I think that, despite not being explained in such an extensive way, they are still quite understandable. That is, the script is good, but it could be better if the parts were divided into more exact intervals. Now talking about the budget explanation, the total amount of US$ 37,304 is divided into some parts; these parts could be better explained, in the case of the budget, I think the details offered are insufficient. For example, under “design and finalize booking workflow”, $10,328 is ordered; what would this workflow finalization and booking projection look like? In which small parts can these tasks be divided and what justifies this value? I don't think we can understand with such solidity how the money would be used, because the explanations are superficial, the proponents only mention in which large part the funding would be divided, without exploring each one of them well. Finally speaking of them, the team, this is the company eRevMax. They explain well who they are and what their area of ​​activity is, providing a link to their website, where we can get to know the company even more closely. Proponents also go into great detail about what each team member does, including a brief resume about them, detailing past experiences and whether they have anything to do with Cardano (and if so, which). We also know their linkedin profiles, so there is a lot of confidence in them and their readiness to successfully execute this proposal. So I think that this part of the feasibility is great.

      "I found the auditability of progress to be great. Many milestones are defined, which can be seen as partial results and small advances to be progressively achieved in the proposal. With them, we know if the process is taking the planned path, if the expected achievements are being achieved. However, I would like to point out three things: 1. Where will these reports be made available? Would it be through a website created especially to audit the proposal, or through the community's standard communication channels, such as telegram and discord? 2. Would the work routines of the professionals involved also be reported, in addition to these goals? That is, whether the tasks necessary for the goals to be achieved will also be made explicit? 3. It would be interesting for bidders to set some specific deadlines for each of these milestones. For example, in month X, this and that must be observed. Already in month Y, such an advance would have to be accounted for. Now, aiming at the final results, the proponents outline good KPIs, both quantitative and qualitative, which would serve as a means for us to perceive if the success that was expected has become reality, being the main way of monitoring this by the “number of travelers who complete the reservations with PRISM credentials and the number of participating hotels”. I think the proponents cover up how we can audit the success of the project itself, but they don't care so much about providing analytical details that would help us understand the direct impacts of this for Cardano. In my view, the main thing that would have to be looked at is whether Atala Prism has become more adopted and passed on in general, beyond this travel extension. Has the project captivated new people to make DIDs of our blockchain, and also to get to know the other technologies, will the number of Ada being purchased and delegated grown? How can impacts for Cardano be measured? So, I think the auditability is good, but it could be better deepened, if some doubts were clarified (as I mentioned in the progress part) as if the analysis directly towards our ecosystem was better targeted in the final results part. \n",

      "The proposal is excellent and perfectly aligned with the objectives of the challenge. The Lido Nation group is already known for previously launched and funded proposals on Catalyst. I coincidentally already evaluated a proposal of theirs, in which they translated a library of content into Sawis (an important African language). I don't know the project they audit various translation services through machine learning. However, the idea here is to expand this translation service to Spanish as well, so that the Spanish-speaking community can better audit their projects. Machine translation would be proofread by people who speak the language natively, which would greatly improve the quality of translations. According to the proponents, machine translations into Spanish are only 60% accurate, meaning proofreading by someone is sorely needed. Proponents also state where the translated content would be made available: “both in the catalyst open API (link attached) and in the lidonation catalyst proposal search tool”. In other words, we know what would need to be done, at first. Then, how it would be done, and third, where would the Cardano community have access to such information. Therefore, I think it is a self-value proposition and that it precisely meets the objectives of this challenge. Here, we are looking to make the auditability process faster, more practical and possible. We know that the number of proposals being funded increases exponentially with each funding round, making it unfeasible for IOG coordinators to keep track of all of them well. We also know that, more and more, the Cardano ecosystem is moving towards self-governance, which means that the members of our community will become more and more self-sufficient in relation to IOG. And for that to happen, all parts of governance need to be well protected, and auditability is one of those essential parts. It is necessary that we have a lot of control and constant monitoring of what has been approved and funded by Catalyst. And it is also necessary that we break the language barrier, as we know that this is the biggest impediment to the real democratization of our blockchain. Therefore, I think that the proposal, in addition to fitting well with the present challenge, would also be beneficial for the multi-language challenge, present in the previous funding round. I have complete confidence in the impact of this project, both because it is being prepared by a team that has already demonstrated its competence in service and because the idea is very well explained (knowing what would happen, how and where the produced content would be made available ).

      "The bidders set milestones that must be followed, and in this way the process would be guided. The way they suggest we evaluate the script is not bad, however, it is superficial. Instead of dividing the temporality into 3 and 5 months, it would be better if they had defined exactly what would happen in each month of the total process. The activities are explained in a very basic way, for example in 3 months what would need to be done is “the translation management system is scaled up to work with a larger group of people + Has a good translation flow and is translating from 10 to 12 articles per week”. Let's analyze it better from here: how would this expansion of the pre-existing system happen? How would they select Spanish speakers to work here? If they want to produce 10 to 12 translated articles per week, how will they select the content that will be produced? Anyway, I think that the way the script is presented, we have a general idea of ​​what would happen, without the appropriate degree of specificity. Moving on to the next topic of analysis, the budget, a total of (approximately) 20 thousand dollars is requested; I found an expensive value for the nature of the proposal. The explanation of how it would be used is average, with some topics being more understandable than others. We know that each translation would cost 45 dollars, but we don't know how long it would take the translator to do it. I think it would be fairer if the value was calculated from the hours of work and not from the translations themselves, because some can be longer, requiring more dedication, while others can be shorter, being done quickly. Some parts are a bit generic, for example $3500 would go towards project administration. Who would do this, and how would they do it? What would the administrator's work routine be? Again, how many hours of work would he devote to this project each week? I think that information should have been provided more specifically, so that our understanding of how the funding would be used was more solid. Finally, analyzing the team involved, as I mentioned in the impact, there is a lot of trust in them, mainly because they are people who have successfully delivered other projects before. The explanations about Darlington and Stephanie are relatively short, more details could have been included about each of them, other experiences they had in addition to the proposals previously funded by Catalyst and so on. Their portfolios or linkedin profiles could be provided so that we know exactly what they have done so far in their professional lives.

I think it would be appropriate for them to suggest more meticulous ways to follow the development of this project. First, it would be necessary for us to follow the entire development, and not just the final results. We need some way to verify what has been partially obtained. And that way would be keeping in constant contact with both the IOG project coordinators and the Cardano community. Since the project lasts 5 months, the ideal would be that at the end of each month we would have updates on how the process was being built. How would the work of the translators, the reviewers, the project manager be doing... would everyone be carrying out their individual duties correctly and responsibly? In fact, would 10 to 12 translations be delivered weekly? Were there problems that needed to be mitigated, and if so, how were they overcome? All this should be constantly informed to the members of our community, the proponents already have a platform (the Lido Nation website); it is enough that monthly reports with all the information I commented were posted there, they could notify about these updates through the more traditional communication channels of our community (such as our discord servers, certainly some of them are focused on auditing the proposals of the present fund). Speaking of the final results, we know that the goal is for 266 proposals to be translated and that the biggest goal is that “the Spanish community is able to obtain the native understanding of the funded proposal and can participate in the audit and presentation of funded proposals”. But how will this be ascertained? Through which qualitative data can we perceive this achievement, and how would this be reflected in the Cardano ecosystem as a whole? Some ways that I imagined would be: a survey could be carried out directly with the Spanish community, so that it could report on how the auditability process of those proposals that have already been financed has been for them, if these translations have played an important role in a better understanding of the contents; also how they are getting involved with other parts of Cardano, as for example they became more active through the greater delegation of Ada, greater use and investment in Dapps and etc... Anyway, it would be important that more direct formals were drawn about how to perceive the advances generated from here. I think that, unfortunately, this is the part that left the most to be desired in the proposal, needing to be revised. \n",

      "In short, the idea of ​​this proposal is to create a community that brings together blockchain enthusiasts, people who are still new to the technologies of our ecosystem and some more experienced members. This group would be called “Cardano India”, and from what I understand it aims to guide the local public in the country about our ecosystem in various ways. I found it very positive as the author explores all the facets that this initiative would have, such as the forum, through which the members of the group would communicate. It would be even more interesting if the bidder determined which platform would be used as a forum. It is also interesting how the larger group would be divided into tribes, as this could increase the chance of greater interaction between the members of the respective tribes, as they would have common interests and areas of activity. The other features presented (voting system, content streaming, peer-to-peer communication, event hosting and course offerings) are also well explained, so we have a very solid understanding of everything that will make up this very multifaceted project. During my reading of the proposal, I thought that there would be many activities, of many natures, being done by many different people, and this would make it difficult to understand what would actually be done on a day-to-day basis at Cardano India. However, the proponent dedicates a topic specifically to explain what would happen there, in “WHAT DOES THE CARDANO INDIA TRIBO DO?”. Soon, my doubts were cleared. It is also super positive as the author of the proposal already makes it clear exactly who would be the target audience of this project, from university students to startup members. Anyway, I think it's a very complete proposal, which meets the challenge's objectives very well and is perfect, at least in terms of impact. In this challenge we are looking for ways to expand the Cardano ecosystem to the inhabitants of India, with the goals of a) benefiting our blockchain, making it more popular, increasing investment in our currency and our applications (Dapps) for example, growing the number of hubs, DAOs, CNFTs in circulation and other ways that we could verify the real adoption of Cardano b) it is also intended that the Indian population benefits from these projects. This can be done through education, that is, we educate the natives about our technologies, giving them the possibility to work with Cardano on technology projects. Even, that they obtain the necessary knowledge to live CAs and VCAs, which generates a very considerable, albeit unstable, extra income. Anyway, I believe this proposal meets all the small goals, deserving the maximum score in impact. \n",

      "Regarding feasibility, I will start by saying that I will be a little demanding in my analysis due to the fact that the proposal is very ambitious, as I explained, many activities are promised, so it is naturally difficult for all of this to be carried out in the optimally and within ideal timeframes. Regarding the script, I think that the time of 1 month (which would be April) is quite short for something so big to be built, and it is not clear if this would just be the beginning of the realization of the project, if it would still be necessary more work after that April period. However, regarding the explanations about this month, I think that what is provided is very positive, as the exact activities for each week are detailed. In this way, we have a well-completed view of everything that would need to be done for the idea to move from the theoretical field to the practical field (at least in the first month of construction). It's also very positive how the proposer sets out what would be possible to deliver at this point in development, so, as with the impact with setting the goals, we have a very solid understanding of the objectives of the proposal. Now talking about the budget breakdown, this part left a little to be desired in my view. The total amount of $28,700 was actually split into parts. However, each of them should have been better explained. For example, let's guide ourselves on the first part of using the money: “Rewards and Incentives for Hosting Hackathons and Competitions - $5,000”. How would these rewards be distributed? How many people would get them? So what approximate value do they intend to set for each reward? In the following part “Developing multilingual resources (video, audio, text documents) - $1,000 / language I, and 5 languages ​​x $1,000 = $5,000”; why would each language cost 1000 dollars? How much would go to video, and to audio, and to text documents? I think that, really, the first parts of the budget needed more detail so that they could be fully understood. The other parts, which relate to the payment of the professionals involved, are explained in a richer and more detailed way, as the price of each hour of work is informed. Therefore, ideally, the same level of detail would be available for all pieces of the budget. Finally, speaking of the team, I think this part is very good because all the necessary information is provided so that we can understand who we are dealing with. We know the names of the professionals involved, as well as a short summary of their professional assignments and their linkedin profiles. This gives a lot of confidence in the team. Therefore, I think the feasibility is already good, with only a few points to improve. \n",

      "The proposer defines several ways in which the proposal development process can be followed. For example, through “tribe growth reports” as well as “reports on a number of tribe members who apply to become Proponents, Voters and CAs”, in addition to “Member Feedback in the form of polls”. I understand that some of the feedback from members of this community will be picked up and analyzed internally, and that's okay. However, regarding the cited reports, how will they reach the members of the Cardano community? It would be necessary for the proponent to explain exactly on which platform he would make them available (either in the discord or telegram groups of the community, by email, through online applications such as Notion, Miro, Google Docs and several others) and also how often they would be posted. In fact, I believe this is my only observation about the auditability of the process, because the proponent already demonstrates that he will keep the Cardano community up to date, which is the crux of the matter, he just needed to better explain how this would be done. Now talking about the final results, I think that we have numerous ways to audit the success because, during the detailing of the proposal, the proposer informs us of many, many KPIs and possible results to be delivered. Therefore, there is no lack of materials to be used as a guide for auditability. In the final part of the breakdown of his proposal, he explains that the ultimate goal is “to reach people from all parts of India and communicate about blockchain and Cardano in the simplest way”. If he hadn't provided ways in which this could be measured, I would say that his proposed scenario still seems a bit abstract, and therefore more detail would be needed. However, as I've said before, it offers us more objective ways of perceiving this bigger picture. Ultimately, what needs to be established again is how the link between these results and the Cardano community would take place. As it is a very large project with many people participating, I think it would be entirely possible for a select group of Cardano India members to gather all this information and make it accessible to the Cardano community, through one of the several platforms I suggested earlier. . Therefore, I think that, as well as the feasibility, the auditability of the proposal is good, just needing some clarification as to how we could all have access to the audited information. \n",

      "And I thought the idea was very good in the theoretical field. In short, it is about “carrying out the research necessary to formulate a viable approach to the use of Atala Prism digital IDs for refugees who have been forced to leave their home countries without identification documents”. The proponents claim that a DAO will be created in order to support these refugees, from what I understand, Atala Prism DIDs would be created for each of them, and partnerships with other institutions such as UNICEF, for example, that already work in helping this community. I found this to be quite promising, however, some important explanations are still missing. Come on. At first, I would like to know more about the DAO that would be created. What activities would take place there? How will such a fragile people, victim of a sociopolitical scenario of chaos, be supported in the most essential instances, such as housing, health, food? How can Cardano contribute to this whole process? How would these people be educated to use their DIDs, and what advantages would this present to them? Another question that came to me was more about the research itself. We know what will be done, but not how it will be done. How will this research develop? By what methods will questions be raised? How will the proponent get in touch with the target audience, given that they are in such a difficult situation? I think that in theory, this proposal can be very useful for our blockchain, as it would work on one of the most urgent problems today, but it is not so clear what would happen in this DAO or through which research methods this project would be. reasoned. So I think that, yes, it could be a project that would help with the widespread adoption of Atala Prism DIDs, which is basically the main objective of this challenge, but more explanation would be needed for me to be really sure about the impact this would have. generate and also how it would meet the specific objectives of the challenge. \n",

      "I found the proposal script to be average, we know that the total time is divided into phases and each phase contains X number of weeks. For example, in phase 1 the time range is from week 1 to 17. Various activities that would be performed in each of these phases are described; I found it average because, in the same way that this description is satisfactory (I thought that the way the activities were explained is very complete, giving us a good view of what is to come); the time intervals are too long. Phase 1 would span more than 4 months, so it would be much better if the bidders had broken the timeline into months so that we knew exactly what would happen in which. As explained, we do not know how long each of these activities would last, nor if it could happen in parallel, etc. Therefore, I think that this part of the proposal still deserved a better detail in this sense. Turning now to funding, bidders repeat the script and add the values ​​of each task in parentheses. I found this part good, because in addition to the bidders specifying what would cost how much, they also inform the hours that would be dedicated to each activity. In this way, we can calculate the value of the hour of work in relation to that activity, and with that we can conclude if it is a fair value or not. Now, speaking of the team, we are introduced to 4 people (Jeffrey Downard, David Watts, Sylvan Magnus and Sarah Holcomb). I think that was the part that left the most to be desired in terms of feasibility, because very little is said about each of those involved. It would be necessary for us to know a little more about their CVs, their relationship with the Cardano ecosystem and also their linkedin profiles, in order to verify all the information mentioned. So I think the feasibility is not bad, but it could improve in some points. \n",

      "The auditability of this project is good, with only a few things to improve. Speaking of the process, the proponents inform the expected results to be delivered in phase 1 of the project. I think it would be more interesting, as I mentioned for the script, if these partial results were divided monthly, in short, in a shorter time period for which it would be easier for us to monitor. I would also like to know how the Cardano community would establish contact with this team and their project, we know that there are standard meetings with the IOG coordinators, but how would the information be verifiable for all members of our ecosystem? I was also in doubt about the other phases. How can we monitor them? Now talking about the end results, I think the proponents report good metrics, but they are mostly numerical, note: “number of whitepaper reads and downloads in academic research services + number of advocates recruited to support fundraising for the efforts relief + more than $100,000 raised is a moderate success; more than $1 million raised is a considerable success.” I agree that it is necessary for us to assess the consequences of a quantitative optimum, but it would also be important for us to know how to qualitatively measure the impacts of the project, both for the refugee community and for the Cardano ecosystem. How would all this contribute to the mass adoption of Atala Prism DIDs? How will our blockchain become better known, respected, used? As I see it, proponents go to great lengths to audit how the project would help refugees through donations, but we also need to know how this auditability would be done targeting our blockchain more directly. Therefore, I would say that this topic of analysis is good, having to be revised in some ways. \n",

      "I'm not sure this proposal would have such a big impact and would meet the challenge's objectives well. The idea itself is interesting, but I don't know if it would work that well... I'll argue. First, reviewing the objectives of the present challenge, we are working towards the dissemination of media content about Cardano in traditional media, different from those in which we already have a wide domain, such as youtube for example, where there is already a series of content related to the our blockchain and we also have a good viewer base. The goal here is to be able to expand knowledge about Cardano to different audiences through different platforms such as radio, local television, etc. Cinema is certainly a media format that is worth exploring, so much so that we have proposals here that suggest the creation of feature films and so on. However, the idea here would be from another angle: using technologies from the Cardano ecosystem to promote the realization of a film festival in which the films, from what I understood, would not necessarily address content on our blockchain. A number of doubts come to my mind regarding this project and its impact on the objectives of the challenge. What kind of films would be shown at the festival? And how many, is expected? Who would be the target audience? How would people be instructed to buy a ticket that is NFT if they don't know or know but don't know how this technology works? How would they perceive the differences between minting NFTs on the Cardano blockchain or other blockchains? And if the proponents themselves claim that Cardano is facing problems inherent in its growth, which generate difficulties such as the delay in processing in the NFTs, how would people derive from this experience the possible benefits of Cardano? Would it be that useful for the ecosystem if only the tickets were NFTs, but the content of the films had nothing to do with Cardano, that there were no debates about our blockchain, that in no way were guidelines disseminated about it that would make it are people interested in becoming active members of the community? In my view, not so much confidence is conveyed that, just by purchasing the tickets, the goals of expanding the Cardano ecosystem are achieved, causing an increase in the number of media content about the blockchain, community members, digital wallets and any other indicators that clearly demonstrate that our ecosystem would in fact be benefited. A suggestion I can make is that before each film, a short video is shown that summarizes what Cardano is, how the purchase of those tickets works on our network, how this technology can be used for various other purposes as well, etc. And it would also be necessary to understand where the festival would take place, this would help a lot to understand the proposal itself and its impact. \n",

      "Unfortunately, the feasibility of the project is not very high, because all the information we needed to know about it is provided in a very basic way. Regarding the roadmap, both in the impact part and in this part, the proponents explain what would be done, but the establishment of the schedule is very superficial. The description of the activities is done in a very summarized way, a single sentence explains each one of them, without the proper detail we cannot understand in a deep way what will happen, how these things would be done exactly. Another observation is in relation to the temporal division. It is said what would happen in the first three months, and then in the next three and finally in the fourth quarter of 2022. In my head, these accounts don't add up much because I believe that the funding of this fund would only be distributed in approximately May/June, which would make the second quarter already the end of the year. But anyway, the time division is very macro, for example, in the first quarter, three activities would be carried out. Does that mean 1 per month? Or would some take longer because they would be more complex than others? Would they happen in parallel? Who would work on them, and what would their work routines be like? For the script to be better, it would certainly be necessary to have more details, for example when the dFest would take place, how long the voting of the films shown would last, how would the publicity process of this event take place, so that the members of the Cardano community could acquire their NFT tickets and those unfamiliar with this technology can learn about to participate. Regarding the budget, a very high amount is requested, and it is not possible to understand exactly how it would be used. The division of parts is somewhat superficial, each of them should be better justified, for example, why is it necessary to invest 10k in UI/UX design? It would be the design of what, exactly...? The format of the festival is not clear, but by this indicator we are led to think that it would be through the digital format. Anyway, how many designs would work on this, what would their working hours be, how much would the price of the work hour be, so that we could see more concretely if the amount asked is fair? As in the case of design, the others should have been better explained, especially marketing, so essential for the success of this project. And finally, as far as the team is concerned, it's not presented properly for us. We only have information about Sebastian Pereira. About your team, we don't know who its members are, what they would do, what their academic backgrounds, professional paths, how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem (we know they are part of a DAO, but who does what in this organization?) ... It would be necessary for us to know all this, their full names, a detailed and verifiable CV (perhaps through their linkedin profiles or github pages), in short, the way in which the team is presented to us, in case you don't know the components of the NFT-DAO through previous work, there is no way to be confident that the team is prepared to execute the project successfully. \n",

      "The suggested auditability modes are quite objective, and allow a basic follow-up on the success of the proposal. In general, what is suggested is: how many tickets were purchased and how many projects were sent to the festival. Of course, these are practical ways to monitor the success of the project, but they are not enough for this to be done in a complete and in-depth way. As it is presented to us, I believe that auditability would be able to cover part of what needs to be analyzed. It would be important, first of all, to establish a way of measuring progress, the development of stages. It would be necessary for the script to be better detailed, perhaps in months, as suggested by me, and that with that we would have content on which to base ourselves for the realization of the phases. It is important that a bridge be established between the NFT-DAO team and the Cardano community, in order to obtain partial results from the process. This could be done through the elaboration of reports at the end of each month, giving us the opinion of how high each task is and constant monitoring of whether things are being done as promised, both in relation to the deadlines, in the right way and more qualified people for each activity. Now about the results, I think it is possible that in addition to the indicators suggested by the proponents, the number of tickets and films at the festival, was analyzed a little further. We could try to understand how this festival impacted the lives of viewers, if really the aim is to show, in the authors’ words, “how blockchain technology and NFTs can work to create a new type of film festival. One that is decentralized, open, transparent and fair” has been achieved. This can be done if the participants understand how NFTs and smart contracts work in Cardano and are interested in making this technology work for other purposes. Contact could be established with them after the festival, either via email or other forms of contact, so that we know how they are applying the knowledge about this technology in their lives and how this project has actually impacted our ecosystem. \n",

      "The proposal is about translating content from the “Emurgo and Cardano Foundation Youtube channel” into a native Indian language, but it is a bit confusing because the proponent cites its languages: Bhojpuri (“Provide translated videos in Bhojpuri educating the Bhojpuri community in India as well as internationally about Cardano and its ecosystem as well as news and current affairs regarding the Cardano Project”) and Hindi (“Thus Hindi speakers cannot learn in their native language. There are 51 million Bhojpuri speakers in India and around the world”) . Anyway, I think that, apart from this confusion, the proposal is a good idea and fits very well with the objectives of the challenge. We know that the biggest difficulty in making Cardano a popular and widely used blockchain is, among others, the language barrier, and if this is overcome, surely more people would have access to the technologies of our ecosystem. In this way, the goal of expanding Cardano to India would be fully achieved, as it would be possible for people to learn about what blockchain is, what Ada is (how to acquire and degas), what are CNFTs and NFTs, what are the cases of use of smart contracts and many other matters that relate to our ecosystem. This would organically benefit this audience, as a) people connected with technology (whether students or professionals) will be presented with a range of possibilities, as there is a great need for skilled labor in Catalyst projects, for example. In fact, not only people in the programming and computing area in general, but also professionals in the business and law fields (I notice that these areas are very popular) b) people could invest in our currency that certainly has the prospect of appreciating, or that is, this could be a good source of income (although not so safe, very profitable). I found it interesting that the proponent has already defined the main metrics and objectives of the proposal; this allows us to have greater clarity on what is being aimed at and certainly makes it easier for the professionals involved to focus, in addition to being of great help for the community to audit the project, as I will comment on the last topic of analysis. However, it would be necessary for the proponent to define which language he will ultimately translate as well as the subjects that would be addressed. To finish my opinion: the proposal in theory perfectly meets the requirements of the challenge, but in practice it is still a little confusing. \n",

      "Let's start by analyzing the script. I think the explanations provided about each month could be more precise, we don't know, for example, how the proponent will do to bring the team together (will this be online or in person, will all the professionals presented in the team part work in every step of the process?). Now about producing 120 minutes of video a month, how would that be done? How would the pre-production of the video be organized, that is, who would dub, who would subtitle? How would the videos to be translated first and then be defined? By the way, about the amount of videos, the proponent says that 1 video would be released every three 3, so the logic would be that at the end of three months the channel would have 30 videos at least right? Because a month has an average of 30 days, 30 days divided by 3 would be 10 videos per month. In three months, 30 videos, but he says the goal is for 10 to 20 videos to be released, so I don't quite understand how he got to this result. Anyway, in addition to defining the amount more precisely for the videos, it would be important for him to outline which subjects would be translated exactly and in which order. It would be very positive if he had created a playlist with the videos he intends to translate. That way we would have a very clear idea of ​​what would be done during the proposal development process. Now talking about the following months, he could have detailed better how this process of establishing partnerships would take place, that is, with whom he intends to establish them and in what way. Now moving on to the division of the requested funding, the proponent claims that it is based on an amount of 15,000 translated words. But how can this be accurately monitored? I think it would be more interesting if he promised, as we have in the script, 120 minutes per month, so it's much easier for the community to check if the amount of content that was promised has been translated. The budget is divided into small parts, the part of the salary of those involved in my view is very well detailed, but the parts referring to social networks and also the payment of the contingency fee should be more explained. I don't know exactly what a contingency fee is. Now let's go to the team involved: we have a lot of details about who they are, we know precisely what they did before the project in their professional lives and we also have their linkedin profiles available to us. With this, a lot of credibility is passed on to the team, and confidence that they are able to successfully execute this proposal. \n",

      "Throughout the detailing of the proposal, the proponent informs us of the KPIs, deliverable results and metrics that can determine the progressive success of this initiative. Therefore, we have a lot of material that serves as a basis for performing the auditability of progress. In other words, we know what the small goals are, what would be considered a partial success, and so on. However, it is necessary for the proponent to better establish what would be the ways that the Cardano community could access this information, because we know what to monitor, but who would do this monitoring work? Would it be the members of the community themselves, or maybe a member of the team is willing to work with it, keeping all of us updated on the tasks developed each month and also on the small achievements? This doubt needed to be resolved for me to consider the auditability of progress perfect. Now talking about the end results: we know that the crux of the matter is to provide content in the native language of the inhabitants of India, so that they can more easily learn about our blockchain and become active members of the Cardano community, one way or another, as I mentioned in impact. Again, I raise the same question: how will this impact be analyzed and how will this information become known to all members of the ecosystem? I believe it is the team's responsibility to study how this proposal will impact the target audience with a lot of specificity and provide this data to the Cardano community. This can be done through synchronous meetings in Town Hall, or by posting a report on online platforms (google docs is easy to use and practically everyone can access). Anyway, we need to understand how, in practice, the translation and posting of this content made a difference in the lives of the Indians involved, and also if this made our blockchain more widely adopted there. Is the working part mentioned by the proponent during the description of his project really making up the team of designers, programmers, animators, finance specialists, anyway? Therefore, I think that auditability is already well underway, but in order for it to be perfect, it is necessary that this contact with the community becomes clearer. \n",

      "I'm not sure if this project is as impactful for Cardano and if it meets the goals of this challenge well. Here, we are looking to fund Dapps that somehow benefit the Cardano ecosystem. According to the challenge description, some specific objectives would be: increase the volume of Ada in circulation, increase the number of CNFTs traded, digital wallets based on Cardano blockchain, add new active members to our community, etc. This project aims to create “a powerful widget embedded directly into the keywords (hotwords) in the news of cryptocurrency sites, so for example, if someone is reading a news that talks about \"\"Cardano\"\", that term will be \"\"emphasis\" and hovering over it will open an overlay with real-time currency price information, volume, % up or % down, etc.” In my view, this is not so necessary, we can access this information very quickly on specialized sites for this, such as the coin market cap, for example. This information can be obtained in a fraction of a second. In addition, this information would be made available for some currencies, according to the proponent, as well as main terms that are part of the cryptographic universe. Therefore, it is clear how this project would not only benefit our blockchain, but several blockchains and currencies. For these reasons, I don't think it's that interesting for us to fund this project , it is not cheap, it would be 47,800 dollars invested for something that will facilitate access to information that would not only say about Cardano and its technologies, besides that, in my opinion, it is already quite simple to have such information, on account of of specialized and quite reliable sites about it. Therefore, my final opinion is that the impact of this proposal is relatively low for the expansion and improvement of our blockchain, compared to the other proposals present in the challenge. The proposal is not so intensely disconnected from the objectives of the challenge, but it also does not meet them with specificity. \n",

      "The feasibility of the project is very good. Starting with the script, we know exactly which activities would be developed each month. In this way, we have a very solid and secure understanding of the construction process of this widget. I believe that I have no criticisms to make about this part of the proposal, because the script is already exactly the way I always suggest in my evaluations: short time allocations and a chronological listing of the tasks to be developed. The only point that could be even better would be, in my opinion, that the activities could be better broken down, for example, in month 2 the “Validation of requirements and design” will take place. How would this be done? How long of the month would it take? And who would work here? However, providing more details would be an increment, as I really think that the way it is presented to us, the script is already good. Now speaking of the budget, the requested amount is divided into very clear parts, it is also very simple to understand how it would be used in practice. Again, my only suggestion is that these explanations were even more detailed, for example, we know the monthly salary of each professional involved, but we don't know how many hours they would dedicate per week to this project. If information on the value of their working hours were provided, we could understand even better how the money was being spent. Finally, analyzing the team, the way the professionals involved in the project are presented is really very good. We know exactly what we are dealing with as they provide their names, their main professional attributions and a rich detail of what they have done before. Their linkedin profiles are also provided, through which we can verify all the information said. Therefore, on this part, there is certainly a lot of confidence that the team is prepared to carry out this project successfully and safely. Therefore, I would say that the feasibility of the project is great, as we are provided with all the necessary information so that we can understand about the project development process, how the funding would be used and who are the people who would execute this proposal; certain that some increments could be made (in script and budget), but only to improve the level of something that is already satisfactory. \n",

      "I don't think the auditability of this proposal is very good, because the indications pointed out by the proponent for us to monitor both the process and the final results are very quantitative, not allowing a broad analysis of what is being done and obtained. For example, when it comes to widget building, progressive success could (according to the bidder) be measured by the following statistics: number of script impressions + number of coins listed + integration with content sites according to roadmap. However, following only these numerical data would not provide us with a good view of the whole, of what the daily work of professionals would be like so that the desired partial results are obtained. Fortunately, we have a good roadmap attached to the proposal, so it is quite possible to audit milestones reached each month. It is simple to solve this issue, it is enough that, somehow, the proponent and his team inform the Cardano community if the tasks planned for that month were actually accomplished and if there were any problems during the process as a whole in that period of time. This survey can be informed through a simple report, or even a brief message, which can be posted on any discord channel dedicated especially to monitoring proposals financed in the current fund. Regarding the final results, the data provided for analysis are 2 quantitative (number of triggers and overlay widget view and number of integrated content sites) and 1 qualitative (CTR: ratio between impression and widget click). However, in my view, none of these indicators can explore whether this project was indeed beneficial to Cardano and how this impact is perceived. Therefore, it is somehow essential that the proponent and his team research and study how the project specifically relates to our ecosystem, what were the gains for Cardano, if any of the specific objectives that I mentioned in the impact were achieved, etc. This information should also reach the community in a simple and direct way, through a synchronous meeting, for example, after or during Town Hall. In other words, the auditability of this proposal is not completely absent, nor is it adequate, requiring real improvements. \n",

      "The idea is very good in theory, fitting perfectly with the objectives of the challenge. We are here looking to fund projects that help establish a friendly and beneficial bridge between Cardano and other blockchains and decentralized solutions. The idea here is precisely to promote a series of events, in which “speakers/experts/community members from other blockchain communities such as BTC, ETH and XRP” would be invited to “present their thoughts at our events will encourage cooperation between our community\". The objective then would be to establish strong networking between us, the Cardano community, and active members of other communities in the cryptographic world. The author argues that the exchange of experiences would promote greater knowledge about Cardano, making our blockchain become central in the logic of the cryptographic world. I understood that, through establishing this contact, we could be strengthened, ideas used in other ecosystems could be adapted for Cardano's projects, and that these events would help popularize our blockchain, making Cardano known to a new audience. In other words, the objectives of the challenge are properly supported on a theoretical level. What worries me here is how this would all be put into practice. We know that the DeFiDiscussions group already promotes some blockchain events in Latin America, I also noticed that they have other proposals in this fund (maybe they have already been financed before too); anyway, apparently this is a group experienced in what they do. However, they would need to provide more details about the events they wish to promote. What remained pending in my view was 1) clarifying where these events would be (their exact location; would they be in Latin America, and if so, in which country? 2) who would be invited, exactly 3) what subjects would be addressed at each meeting (the agenda of the day) 4) how would the production of such events be, that is, would they consist of a lecture, followed by a debate session, a networking moment itself? I believe it is a great idea, but it should have been better explained, so that the readers of the proposal could solidly visualize how this would become a reality and then generate the desired impacts for the present challenge. \n",

      "The feasibility of the project is low. We don't have enough detail about the things we would need to know to fully understand the project, neither in the script, nor budget nor team presentation. Starting with the script, the proponent states that “The timeline for this project would be in line with the timeline of \"Networking/Education LATAM\". He says this as if all the readers of the proposal are situated on the timeline of this other project, when they are not. We know that there would be 24 events distributed monthly, that is, this project would last a total of 2 years. However, we have very little detail about the pre-production and even what the day of each event would be like. It would be necessary for the bidder to attach various information here. Firstly, I would like to understand what tasks would have to be accomplished in order for each event day to become possible. Renting the space, hiring a speaker, inviting those involved, defining topics to be discussed on the day, food and drinks for part of the networking... many issues would have to be organized, and it is not explained how this would happen. About the day of the events itself: how many hours would each meeting last? Would it be in the afternoon, morning, night? What would the planning schedule look like? How long, for example, would the opening of the event last, and how long would the lecture be? When would a debate session take place, in which guests were encouraged to speak out? I think there's a lot of understanding both about what would happen before and during these encounter days. Talking now about the budget, I think the explanations are too shallow. Each event would cost a total of 750 dollars, of which 150 would go to commercialization (what would be commercialized?); 200 for outreach and guest speakers (what's the difference from outreach to pay and guest travel? Was it some kind of marketing? This part got a little confusing) and travel and guest speaker pay. As I reported, some doubts came to me, I also keep thinking about the issue of price variation between the hours of work of different guests, which would probably happen. And finally, about the team, in my opinion it is the best part, although ideally more information should have been said about each one. Starting with the fact that not everyone attaches their linkedin profiles (it would be better if they did); then, it is explained in just 1 line (approximately) about each professional involved, basically their professional area. I think it would be interesting if they had attached a more extensive curriculum of each to the proposal itself, in order to get to know their previous experiences. Therefore, I think that all feasibility issues deserved more detail, so that the project as a whole could become more understandable in practice. \n",

      "The proponent claims that the auditability of progress would be measured by the number of foreigners who would attend the event, join the community on social media and also by the “contact information shared between members of different projects”. I think that last topic deserved to be explored much better. How can we find out what information has been shared? What projects have come together, or at least collaborated with each other? What relevant ideas can we adapt to the Cardano ecosystem, discussed at these events? I think the core of this proposal is really this: the exchange of experiences, how Cardano can become central in the face of so many blockchains, what we have to contribute to the rest of the cryptographic community, so that our blockchain becomes better known and adopted, and also that strategies that have worked for the wide adoption and strengthening of blockchain like Ethereum can be applied at Cardano. All of these questions fall under this last topic of shared information, but the proponent does not clarify either how such data will be collected or how it will be shared with all members of our ecosystem. If all this had been clarified, I think the auditability of the project would be more adequate. Now talking about the final results, the information given is also very shallow, we only know that the success scenario would be “to establish and grow a community of people from different projects in our events. Expanding the Cardano network into the networks surrounding other blockchains.” We have this perception since the impact of the proposal, but how can this be measured? It would be necessary for the proponent and his team to do a case study, raising the main data that could indicate that Cardano has benefited from these connections with other blockchains; some of this data could be: establishment of a partnership, projects being developed together, advice from some professionals from other blockchains; All of this could result in greater adoption of Cardano, i.e. increase in transactions on our blockchain, greater volume of Ada in circulation, CNFTs being minted and traded, etc. All this information should reach the Cardano community in a direct, practical and easy way. So I conclude my review by saying that unfortunately I don't think the proposal is auditable for the information given, I really believe that this topic should have been more detailed and monitoring solutions should have been better provided. \n",

      "The proposal perfectly meets the proposed challenge. Here, we seek to finance projects that can establish some relationship between Cardano and other blockchains, in this case, the blockchain to work on would be the A Fantom (FTM) platform. The Adatar.me project seeks to replace long and complicated addresses with short and simple names. The problem at hand is that pretty much every time cryptocurrency holders want to make a transaction, they need to send 1 coin first to make sure the destination address is correct, so the transaction fee ends up being paid twice, unnecessarily. If the addresses were our names or some codename chosen by us, we would have much more security in carrying out these transactions, it would not be necessary to make a test shipment and the respective fees would be paid only once. In other words, the project is extremely relevant and I believe that all cryptocurrency users, whether on Cardano or another blockchain, will be interested in participating in it, in my view there is no doubt about the positive impact that this application will generate. Therefore, the goals of helping to establish good business and a good relationship with other blockchains will undoubtedly be achieved, which in the end will undoubtedly help Cardano to become more and more respected and widely used. \n",

      "I think the proponents could have given more details about the project development process, we know that this is an expansion to something that already exists (address simplification is already being worked on for our blockchain), however it would be interesting that they could expose to the readers of the proposal some activities necessary for the evolution of this project. They state that the expansion will start at the beginning of the 4th quarter of the year and finish at the end of that same quarter. What would happen in month 1, and 2, and 3? In my view, the script gives us an overview of what will happen, but not as specific as I would like. Now talking about the budget division, this part is very simple to understand. The asking price is $8,000, which is the equivalent of a full-time software engineer's salary or half a salary for two part-time engineers - I really don't think there's more to explore here. The understanding of how the requested money will be used is complete. Now, talking about the team, this part is impeccable, they are very qualified and well-known professionals within the Cardano community, the Loxe Inc group. The company develops some projects using Cardano's blockchain technology, such as the Win Win platform (conflict moderation outside the court system); we know in practice that they are competent and highly prepared professionals. In addition, they also attach a good description about each one, so that we can individually understand more about their careers and previous work. Therefore, the feasibility of the project is very high, my only suggestion is really to explain the script better. \n",

      "Regarding auditability, the proponents explain very succinctly how the project can be audited both in terms of the process and the final results. Speaking of process, we know that the desired milestones are “the launch of the adatar.me FTM extension on testnet and mainnet at the beginning and end of Q4 2022”; and the end result would be the extension of the “adatar.me and organic adoption by your community” project. I think these are good ways to monitor the project, but I will make some suggestions for this process to become even better explored. In the process part, I believe that the team will meet with the IOG coordinators monthly in order to present the partial results, I think that the contents discussed at that moment could also be accessible to members of the Cardano community, as a closer way to keep track of what has been done in the month. Regarding the final results, it would be very interesting if the team carried out a small study of how this application contributed to the better performance of FTM blockchain transactions, if the number of fees paid decreased, if people also became interested in Cardano, a since this technology was developed by a company that operates mostly on our blockchain, and so on. That is, quantitative and qualitative data that make this perception of success more measurable. Therefore, I like the auditability, I believe in the seriousness of the work of these professionals, but I also think that with these suggestions the level of analysis would be more in-depth. \n",

      "I think this proposal is very good and meets the objectives of the challenge well, the idea is a series of 10 animated videos in high quality (who would do this would be a studio, which has attached its website, where we can see their previous work and really are very beautiful animations). From what I understand the intention here would be to publicize these videos in different places, it is not clear if they would be posted on a youtube channel, or if the files would be shared directly with the Cardano community, so that we can choose where the videos would circulate . I believe it would be the second option, because, from what the proponents explain, the idea is precisely to present these videos in meetings, send them to different platforms, use them as a kind of ready-made tool to explain what Cardano is and its technologies. In fact, it is a little difficult to conceptualize what our blockchain is and the things that surround it for those who have never heard of it or know nothing about the crypto world. In this sense, having ready-made media content that explains such concepts in a simple way that is compatible with all audiences, through animation, is certainly a more practical and safer way to do this. I think the proposal would align even more with this challenge if the intention to take such content to more traditional media, such as local televisions, were explicit (we know that the videos would be dubbed in 6 languages, which would make them very accessible to different groups). In this way, the goal of reaching a different audience through more traditional platforms would be achieved, and the objectives of the challenge 100% achieved. I think that three things should be explained better in this proposal: 1) what is the content of each video. We know there would be 10, but what would each of them address, and in what order? 2) which languages ​​these videos would be dubbed into (probably the most spoken, such as English, Spanish and French, but having this information could help to measure the impact of the project. 3) as I said, how would the distribution process of the videos, whether this part of the work would be entirely the responsibility of the Cardano community or whether the studio would also invest in some form of outreach. With that, I think it's a great proposal that has a chance of generating a positive and real impact, but it could be a little more detailed in terms of explaining its characteristics and, consequently, its impact. \n",

      "The viability of the project is not good, unfortunately. There is no roadmap, even though we know that each video would take approximately 20 days to create, and how long each task would take (e.g. query and roadmap 10 days, voice 2 days and so on), it is still not possible to visualize how these tasks would localize over time. That is, a roadmap with probable dates is not established. For example, it's 10 videos, right? Each one would take 20 days to produce, which would give us a total of 200 working days. But let's simplify to the preposition: 1 video per month. It would be necessary to build a script as follows: in June, after funding, video 1 would be created and made available, which would have such a theme, would be translated into such languages ​​and would start to be produced, for example, on the 5th and delivered on the 25th of month. Each week, such tasks would be accomplished. In this way, we would have a more solid view of the process, in relation not only to what would be needed to produce the videos, but also how this would relate to time and space. Regarding the script, we don't know why it would take 2k USD per minute of animation. This is very very expensive, it would be necessary for the proponents to argue the need for such a high investment for such a short time of video. I would like to understand how much each professional involved would receive per hour of work, in this way I would be able to have a clearer view of how the requested money would be used and if this is fair. I would also like to know if there would be any portions here being used for marketing, since this issue of distribution was very uncertain, in my opinion. And finally in relation to the team, we are not properly introduced to who would carry out this project, even if the studio's website has been attached and they have proved through previous works that they know what they do, we would need to understand: who is this producer, this screenwriter, the consultant Cardano and etc? We would need a series of information about them to be said, such as: 1) their full names 2) a small resume of what they have done so far 3) how they relate to Cardano (in this case, I understood that only one person would have a connection with our blockchain, but how would this knowledge be passed on to the audiovisual team?) 4) a way to prove all the information said so far. In short, you can't trust people you don't know. Therefore, I think that all the important information about feasibility (script, staff and budget) is not adequately explained and a revision is necessary. \n",

      "Sounds like an auditable proposal to me, but I would like more detail here as well. Proponents claim that the video development process can be tracked online through a website called Instagannt. It would be interesting if they made available the link that would be used to monitor deadlines, layouts and scripts, so we could go in and see how this tool works, which I didn't particularly know, hadn't heard about before. Generally the proposals are shared by github, notion, miro, google docs... As it is a different tool from the most usual ones, the inclusion of this link was quite necessary. Anyway, it would also be interesting for the proponents to explain in more detail the contents that would be posted on Instagannt, how often they would be updated, etc. of these videos. However, I usually suggest that this be done, that is, some bridge between the project team and the rest of the community, so as this has already been proposed, my only suggestions are really that this be further explained and the link made available. Now talking about the final results, the proponents mention what could be evaluated: the videos themselves, their reach, if new projects are being created in Cardano from the moment that new people understand about our blockchain and etc. I agree that this is how we can measure the impact, the results of the campaign, but I think it's not appropriate to just wait for the community to run after such data. It would be much better if the team itself made a report, trying to numerically measure each of these variables, trying to establish contact with its audience, in order to really understand how these videos helped in what would be proposed, and that this report was sent directly to the community Cardano. In this way, we would be aware of all the results directly and safely. Finally, I will give 4 for the auditability of this proposal, because I think it is already good, but it can improve, through better clarification about Instagannt and the elaboration of reports with the final data of the project. \n",

      "I think this idea is brilliant, but I have my doubts as to whether it fits well with the goals of this challenge. The present challenge aims to finance projects that help to disseminate Cardano-related content in specific communities, taking into account local characteristics such as the language that is spoken and cultural factors. In my view, the challenge of hubs is like that of new members on board, being a more micro view of the thing. The proposal in question aims to summarize proposals launched in funds 9 and 10, as we can clearly see in the following excerpt: “each short video/podcast lasting approximately 2 minutes/video containing information compiled, analyzed and evaluated for about 25% of the proposals in each Catalyst Fund”. I think this idea would fit better in the challenge of Dapps, because if these summaries are coined in some application, it would certainly be a platform that would benefit the Cardano community in full; because it would make it simpler and more accessible for us to know what (at least a part) of the proposals of the chosen funds are about. In other words, it would be a Dapp that would add value to the community from the moment that the engagement of its members would be boosted, because in fact, it is very complicated for us voters to read so many proposals; there is no time or patience for this, there are lots and lots of information to be absorbed in a short space of time. That's why I believe that the idea of ​​summarizing these contents in a few minutes, in a more practical format to be consumed, such as videos and podcasts, is extremely relevant. I just really don't think it has as much to do with the challenge because it would be a way to benefit the Cardano community as a whole, and not a way to create a hub, to bring specific people together in a specific context, as is sought in this challenge. If this proposal were aimed at a particular community, I believe it would be more aligned with what we are looking for. One observation I would like to make in this part of the impact is on the issue of the number of proposals reviewed. The proponent states that “building a list of 500 to 600 proposals depends on the 2Min Review community. As a result, there is a potential risk that multiple high-quality proposals will be filtered out of this List. To deal with this, the 2MIN Review team has set aside 5% of the total budget as a reserve to ensure the quality of the content.” How would this reserved money contribute to ensuring the quality of the chosen proposals? I'll give it a 4, because the idea is really good, but it doesn't fit, at least in my opinion, 100% with this challenge. \n",

      "I found the division of the script of this proposal very interesting. Here, we have two faces that complement and depend on each other: goals and tasks. In the goals part, the proponent explains what the specific objectives are for that phase of the project, what they want to achieve until then, and in the tasks part, we are informed which activities would need to be developed for those things to be conquests. I think this division was great, because usually people just explain what they want to achieve, and they don't make it clear how that would be possible. My only suggestion at this point is precisely that the temporal division should be made more exact. We know exactly what is intended and how it could be achieved, but we have no information on when these things would be done. When fund 9 starts, how much time is expected to elapse before proposals are filtered (choose proposals that are translated and summarized)? And the review of articles? In which months of 2022 would each of these things be achieved? It is not possible to understand the time that each task would take to be executed, nor in which months of the year they are expected to be ok. So this script issue prevents us from having a complete understanding of the process. Now talking about the funding, I really have no criticism at this point, the team explains in a rare wealth of detail how the $50,000 (approximately) that was requested would be achieved. With this, we know the hourly value of the professionals involved, as well as the specific price of video production, administration of the youtube channel, etc. In my opinion, this part of the proposal is perfect. Finally, speaking of the team, we also know a lot of information about each stakeholder, so there is a lot of credibility and confidence that they are prepared to successfully execute the proposal. To begin with, they are a well-experienced team, we are informed at the end of the proposal that they have already launched (and been funded, as I understand it) several proposals in previous funds. This fact alone is a good indicator that they have the necessary technical experience to develop this project, but we still have specific information about each of those involved. We know their names, their main functions, a little bit of their work history and we have several social network links where we can get to know them completely, and not only professionally, as they also attach twitter profiles, in some cases. Therefore, the feasibility of the project is very good, my only caveat is that the issue of temporality would be better specified in the script. \n",

      "The auditability of this proposal is quite high. Regarding the development process, we have 3 main indicators, listed by the bidder: average viewing duration + average percentage viewed + new subscriber. I have been observing that in most of the proposals that I evaluate the authors are very concerned with drawing numerical statistics that will demonstrate in a safe way the success that is obtained in a gradual way. However, I think the most appropriate thing would be that, in addition to such data, which is clearly important, we also constantly monitor the work routine of those involved. Remember the script, where the proponent divides the process into goals and tasks? We also need to audit the tasks, not just the goals. In this way, we would carry out a more complete audit of the process. It is necessary that at least one active member of the Cardano community closely follows the work routine of this team, preferably someone who is already very active in the voting process, so that they can more easily understand whether the partial objectives are being achieved. This person could meet at the end of each month, or week, it depends because everything revolves around the total duration of the project (which is not clear), and in these meetings he or she would relate to the team's work routine, knowing if everything is happening as it should, if the agreed deadlines are being respected, etc. And as for the final scenario, I think the bidder very richly traces the overall success (I've noticed that this bidder is great at detailing what she says, which for me is essential). What remains pending is how the Cardano community will be aware of such information. Will a final report be prepared, explaining whether all intended milestones have been achieved? Will a survey be carried out directly with the community, in order to see if the main objective of the project (facilitating the knowledge of a greater number of proposals at the time of voting) was successfully achieved? Anyway, I would like it to be clearer how the Cardano community would be aware of all the information mentioned. So I think the auditability is great, as are the other two topics in the proposal, just needing a few tweaks to make it perfect. \n",

      "The proposal is great and fits perfectly to the objectives of the challenge. The idea is well summarized in the following excerpt: “Empower merchants with the easy-to-use Mobile App and DApp to receive payment for goods and services in cryptocurrency as an alternative payment method without additional hardware or software.” That is, the proponent suggests creating a platform that helps small entrepreneurs, as he mentioned in the examples, coffee shop owners, small shops, workshops, etc., to learn how to receive payment for their products or services in the form of cryptocurrencies. This is really something quite revolutionary, my impression is that most of the proposals of this challenge aim to reach startups, entrepreneurs in the technology sector or a more niche audience. Really, we need to focus on who is likely to adopt our blockchain technologies because they already have some knowledge of this technology; with this audience, adoption is more likely to be well accepted. However, I also think it's super important that we invest in ordinary people, those who still don't understand what blockchain is and what are the advantages of working with cryptocurrencies. Most people think that cryptocurrencies are just quick and easy ways to get rich, which we know is not true. In fact, our currency is subject to wide variations, we do have the possibility of making a profit if Ada appreciates, however, the focus here is to help people understand the application of blockchain in everyday life, benefiting at the same time these people and also increasing Cardano's popularity. This challenge aims precisely at that, to promote Dapps that invest in the expansion of the technologies of our ecosystem, and in the present case this would certainly be possible if more people started to market their products or services with our cryptocurrency. I believe that the project, if done properly, would be a solid gateway for new users active in our community, as at first they would be seeking their own benefit with this project; and so, organically, they would increase the reach and use of technologies relevant to Cardano. It is very positive how the proponent explains what the advantages would be for merchants in adopting cryptocurrencies, this demonstrates that he already clearly knows how he will captivate them to adopt this initiative. The two observations I would like to make about the impact of this proposal are: it would be positive if the author made it clear that the cryptocurrency in question would be Ada and only Ada, since at no point in the detailing of the proposal is this stated; It would also be nice if he made it clearer which digital wallets he would work with, since we have the official wallets on our blockchain (Yoroi and Daedalus, for example), so it would be more beneficial for Cardano if these were the options used in the project. \n",

      "Unfortunately, the information given by the bidder about the roadmap is very vague. All we know is that the “project will take 3 months to 5 months to develop / AND a few more months for promotion and testing”. However, it would be necessary for the proponent to inform what would happen each month. Of course, it will be 3 to 5 months of production, but what activities will be developed and in what order? How long would each action take to develop, who would do what? Within these 3 to 5 months, what are the expectations for partial deliveries? Anyway, I think the way the process is described is very superficial and inadequate, I suggest that the proponent, first of all, divide this time interval into months and score what is planned to be done in each of them. The more detail, the better, in fact, the more explanations are described about the activities, we, the readers of the proposal, will be able to form a more solid understanding of the development process, the steps that would need to be fulfilled for the realization of the whole. Regarding the funding requested, 162 thousand dollars (a very high amount!), I think this part is much better than the script. We know which parts the total amount would be divided into (Software Architecture and Design / Software Development / Database Development / etc) as well as the amount of work hours that would be spent in each of these areas and the price per hour of work of those involved. I think the understanding of how the money would be used is very clear, it is up to the Cardano community to determine whether the asking amount is fair or exorbitant - information to conclude that, we have. Finally, speaking of the team, the presentation of each team member is quite adequate, as we know their names, areas of professional activity and also some examples of previous work they have already performed. They also provide their resumes, so that we can confirm all the information said. I think the only question that could have been better addressed is each professional's relationship with the Cardano ecosystem - are they active members of our community? if so, in what way? Do they invest in Ada, do they already have digital wallets, buy CNFT, use any of our Dapps? This relationship is not clear, and in my view it is essential that we know about this information, because that way we would have more security in relation to the preparation of the team to work with the technologies of our ecosystem. Therefore, I think that the feasibility of the project is average, with some points to improve (the script, mainly) and another very detailed part (budget). \n",

      "The auditability of the progress appears to be adequate, as the proponent states that the work of building the Dapp can be followed through the website provided (http://payecrypto.com). However, I went to the site and they ask you to register, I think it would be more interesting if this wasn't necessary, because maybe Cardano community members who want to check how the development process is going don't necessarily want to link to the project, just monitor it. I also think it would be necessary for the proponent to better specify what content would be made available on this site and how often it would be updated. However, the idea is correct, this is what I usually suggest as a way of auditing the proposals, creating a solid bridge between the team and their work together with the Cardano community. What is missing here is just to understand the characteristics of this bridge. Now talking about the final results, the auditability of this part is based on the following aspects: “Wide adaptation of our application / High number of registered users / Easy to use by the small company in daily payments”. Again, I believe this is the way to go, but the proponent should have explained how exactly they are going to verify this data and transmit it to the Cardano community. How can we understand the real impact of this Dapp on the lives of small business owners? In my opinion, it would be necessary for a survey to be carried out directly with them, and the results to reach our community through the elaboration of a final report, for example, to be made available in some of the various media of the Cardano community. It is also necessary for us to understand what was the impact of all this for our blockchain, in fact, more people have become adepts of our currency, have created smart wallets, are they actively engaging with the possibilities found in Cardano? In my view, there was a lack of depth on how all this data will be collected and presented to the Cardano community. Therefore, I think auditability is well underway, but it needs more detail and clarity as to how we members of this ecosystem will stay abreast of all updates and information on the final results. \n",

      "I don't think this proposal fits the challenge, nor am I sure about how this idea could be put into practice and how it would affect the target audience. The idea is to bring to children and teenagers knowledge relevant to the Cardano ecosystem, instructing and educating them about what blockchain, cryptocurrencies, Cardano, Bitcoin and so on are. I'm really not sure if this is a good idea, in my view it might be interesting to produce youth content about it, focusing on those teenagers who already have an interest and a certain inclination towards business and technology. As a kind of playful magazine but that also introduces them to these subjects in a safe way. But for kids, I don't see much need to approach blockchain at this stage of life, honestly. I think at this stage, we're still understanding what money is, let alone something complex like a decentralized network of transactions. I think it is healthy to introduce financial education as early as possible, in a way that is compatible with the understanding of the target audience. For example, for very young children, the concept of value and exchange is taught at first, for example (let's go with a very playful example) a house is worth 3 cars, and so on. But how could we talk about something as advanced as Cardano's knowledge in fun, simple and accessible language? In fact, why should we do that? I would like the proponent to better argue in defense of their idea, both as to why it is necessary and impactful. If the magazine were focused on young people between the ages of 15 and 18, I think things would be different, because this is an age when they start to study computing, basics of programming, financial mathematics, and so on. So, in my perception, it's a more compatible audience with this introduction to blockchain. Another point is, I don't know if this proposal fits well with the objectives of the challenge, because in the hubs challenge we intend to create effective and simple ways to bring knowledge about Cardano to a specific group, respecting their cultural and linguistic characteristics. Until we have a very specific audience here, children and teenagers who speak English and Portuguese. However, it is not enough to be a single community, how many children speak English, they can be from the United States, Australia, United Kingdom, in short, culturally very different places! In the same way, in the case of Portuguese, we could be talking about a Brazilian, African, Portuguese-Portuguese audience, anyway... Unfortunately, I don't feel that this proposal aligns with what is sought here and I'm also a little unsure about its validity this idea, and, in my view, it is necessary for the author to argue better about it. \n",

      "The script is ok, we know what will happen over the months, but we don't have much detail about each of the activities mentioned. For example, it is said that, in the first two months, the script for the book would be written, the characters created, and everything would be validated. But how would the script creation process be done? Who would select how this story would be told? What topics would be addressed first? How would such technological concepts be described playfully? Who would be responsible for the script? The third month would be entirely dedicated to writing the chapters. I would like to understand how many there would be, who would write them, how long it would take for each and so on. Finally, details. We don't have many details on how this proposal would develop out of practice. I think the script is good for us to have an idea of ​​what happens, not for us to understand the details of how it all happens. Regarding the team, this part of the proposal, in my opinion, is perfect. We know exactly who we are dealing with: their names, linkedin profiles and we have a good description of their CVs, first it is said what area they work in and then it is explained what they have done professionally so far, at least in summary. I really felt confident in this team, as in addition to having explained their previous experiences very well, they made it possible for us to have proof of this by looking at their linkedin profiles. So I have no criticisms on that part of the proposal. Now finally, speaking of the budget: approximately 34 thousand dollars are requested to carry out this proposal, and this total amount is divided into smaller parts. However, each of these parts could have been better explained. The journalist will have a monthly salary of USD 1200, but why? What will his workday be like, how many hours per week will he commit to this project? In the same way that I ask in the case of the journalist, I would like to know more about how the work practice on the project will be for other professionals, the writer, the designer, etc. Look, I'm not saying that the amounts charged are unfair, however, in order to convey a more sense of need, it would be necessary for the proponent to better explain the degree of commitment each professional would have towards the production of this magazine. Therefore, my opinion on the feasibility of the project is as follows: the roadmap could be better detailed, as well as the budget; the description of the team members is excellent. \n",

      "The auditability suggested for the development process of this project is not sufficient. We only have numbers, which would serve to quantitatively understand the reach of the magazine produced: number of hits to the website, number of printed magazines, number of shares of the digital magazine (what would that be?). In this way, we even understand at what level the project is, however, it is not possible to understand if the small goals that were established were met. As it is a playful project, my suggestion is to have meetings, maybe monthly, but bimonthly would be a good size, where the project leader would demonstrate to the members of the Cardano community what stage the development is in, show the results obtained so far, such as drafts of the script, first illustrations, the balloons being inserted in the comics and so on. I think it is more interesting that these meetings are held in this case because the project is very visual, so the demonstration of the drafts is indispensable. I usually suggest that monthly reports be prepared and sent to the community in some of our media, such as discord and telegram, for example, but I don't think this is the best way for us to audit this project, specifically. In these meetings, it could also be said whether the professionals involved were able to follow the work routine they had planned, if they faced any difficulties and if so, which ones, and so on. Now talking about the final result, the success scenario, in my opinion the author of the proposal explores qualitative variables as well, in addition to numbers, such as the testimony of parents and children. But how would these testimonies be collected? I loved the idea, but I would like to know how this would be put into practice. Maybe school meetings? Maybe by video call? And how could every community be aware of the data collected? In addition to knowing the number of schools visited, it would be great if we knew how these visits were, the reception of the children, the teachers, how did all this really impact those involved? In my view, a slightly longer general meeting would be necessary for such information to be properly passed on to the Cardano community. In general, my opinion about auditability is that it is strong in some points but has to improve in others, it is stronger in the construction of a final scenario than in the progressive follow-up of parts. \n",

      "I don't know if this proposal would be of any value to our blockchain because it's very specific. It is about creating a platform that is the bridge between wine producers and consumers, in order to register on the blockchain some characteristics that relate to the quality of wines, such as temperature, storage conditions and other variables that can contribute to the final customers/consumers have full control over everything that involves their wines. The issue I think is that, generally, the target audience of the wine market is people who are a little older, those who are able to buy expensive wine are usually part of a more economically privileged portion of the population, so we can start to draw a customer profile, which I don't think would be people who would be so interested/easily in dealing with blockchain. It is a very specific niche, I think this proposal could work if the application were launched in places where the population has more contact with the technologies relevant to the Cardano ecosystem and at the same time it is a place with a consolidated wine market. In this case, I believe it would work, and maybe this new type of business could expand to other locations and become popular among wineries and customers, but to be launched to the general public, I don't know if it would work as well, if it would have a good customer adhesion, how to reconcile these two branches (blockchain and wines) and so on. So, unfortunately, I don't think this application is a very sure bet for us in the Cardano ecosystem, if it will create a Dapp that increases the number of Ada holders, transactions on our blockchain, in short, the popularization of our technologies, being worth the effort. 35k investment that was requested. So I suggest that the proposal be launched on a smaller scale, asking for perhaps less funding and aimed at a more specific audience. For example, we could think of some European country, like Germany, where the population has a good purchasing power and the blockchain already has a good base. \n",

      "This part of the proposal is good, I consider that 2 questions are adequate and 1 of them could be more detailed. Starting with the script, I found it to be well divided, the tasks are listed and it is also indicated how long each one would take, so we have a very solid understanding of the process. However, it is a little worrying to know that only phase 1 is contemplated in this proposal and with this amount of money. It's four weeks that will cost 35k and I wonder how many % of the project we would be advancing with that level. Would it be appropriate for the bidder to pass on this information to us, what is the total number of phases to be done so that the final product is delivered? And in relation to this first phase, when would it start, in which month of this year would its results be delivered? These were the doubts that arose in relation to the temporality of the proposal. Regarding the team, this part of the proposal is quite adequate. We know who the individual team members are, their names, roles in the project and we can check the information provided through the linkedin profiles that were attached to the proposal. However, it could be even better if they explained, for example, the relationship of these professionals with the Cardano ecosystem. However, I think the way the team was presented is good enough for us to be confident in their ability to successfully execute the project. The part that I thought left something to be desired in the explanation of the budget. Phase 1 of the project will last 1 month, and we have very high values ​​here. And project manager would earn 10k to work 4 weeks, but how many days a week would he dedicate to the project because his salary would need to be so high? The marketing part would be 6.5k, but why? What marketing strategy would be adopted, what justifies the value? How would the professional in the field work, how would he manage to merge two such specific audiences (high-end wine connoisseurs and Dapp users)? This last part was, in my opinion, very superficial, it is not possible to clearly identify the need for this funding for this period of time. \n",

      "The auditability of this proposal is a little problematic because the authors deliver possible ways to measure the success of the acceptance of the application by the user, as well as the revenue, that is, the profits. This is not exactly a way to understand if this phase was done successfully, but if the project as a whole was successful, you know? I think it would be important for us to focus on the partial results before we go into the finals. This can be done through, for example, deliveries of advances according to time. Phase 1 would last a total of 4 weeks, weekly team meetings could be held with some community members in order to understand what progress was made, how each professional worked, whether they reached their specific goals involved and so on. I think it's quite possible for us to track the progress of this proposal based on the roadmap provided and the short timescale. We know what needs to happen each week, just check it out. And so we could move on to the next phase. That's why I'll give it 3 stars: I don't think the authors clearly establish ways to monitor this phase of the project, but they give us indirect means for it, with a very detailed script. If the proposal goes ahead, funded at this stage and in the next ones, it would be very interesting to see how these two niches, wine and blockchain, would be coming together, and what results this would be causing for our Cardano blockchain. Therefore, it is possible to audit the proposal, even if adequate focus has not been given to this part of the project in the detailing of the proposal. \n",

      "I found this proposal quite promising, because it seeks to combine artificial intelligence, metaverse and our Cardano blockchain. The authors justify that, just as NFT has boomed in recent times, the same thing will happen with the metaverse and developing a music-oriented project in this context can be a really positive thing. It would have been better if they had better explained the SingularityNET concept. It is possible to understand what this is based on the context, the proposal and the objectives, but for laymen, people who do not know the project before (I remember seeing this name at some point in previous funds, but I don't remember well ) an accessible explanation would be essential. I believe that proposals with a very technical nature should always be leveled, so that CAs, voters and all types of people who come into contact with them understand 100%. Returning to the proposal and how it relates to the objectives of the challenge: yes, I believe it is a project that dialogues and meets the specific objectives of the challenge well, because it will integrate products that already exist (our blockchain, for example) with concepts that are still getting stronger (virtual reality and metaverse), and the key to everything will be music. It is certainly a universal topic, I have already seen some proposals that address it, alleging the difficulties of artists in producing and presenting their music (the authors cite the example of the restrictions generated by the pandemic, but there are also many other bureaucracies in the middle). Creating a virtual environment that can benefit both artists and our blockchain, as it will increase the amount of transactions made on Cardano through smart contracts, NFT exchanges, create new pools and attract a new audience, for example, is something that it certainly fits with what we're looking for here. It is also positive as it already has a destination to host its application (Somnium Space). Therefore, the only thing I would like to point out would be to better explain the technical concepts so that everyone can understand the proposal equally. \n",

Starting with the script, the authors establish what would happen over the months, I found this part the best of all auditability because it is well punctuated as the entire development process would take place. Despite this, it would be even better if there were more details about these activities, such as who would execute them, would they happen in parallel or would one start and then, when completed, the other would start? How long would each last? What would the reward system architecture look like (again, more lay people might not fully understand what the authors meant here). Although they were concerned about separating the activities by month, it would be important for them to include here a small explanation about each one of them, in this way we would have a much more solid view of the process. Regarding the project's expenses, I believe that the salaries of the professionals involved are quite fair, but it would be interesting if it was explained a little better about their work routines. How many hours would you dedicate to this project? In this way, we would be able to better understand the value of their working hours. And finally, speaking of them, the team involved introduces itself very briefly, we know their names, roles in the project and a (very) brief history of what they have done so far. My suggestions are: give more details about their careers; provide some means for us to contact them, if necessary; provide some evidence of their CVs, for example linkedin profiles if they have one.

The team tells us what their specific goals are, they say they aim to create “a functioning ecosystem with millions of users across multiple metaverses”, detailing how this would be done through clearer topics, so that it is possible to monitor if indeed success is achieved. It was obtained. In terms of results, we can also see if this project was successful or not, based on the information provided. And about project monitoring: this part is very easy to monitor, since the team, in the previous topic, establishes which tasks would be developed each month. I suggest that some members of the Cardano community, preferably those who are interested in the topic of music and know something about the metaverse and virtual reality, establish a direct follow-up of the activities, together with the team, and bring this information to the rest of the Cardano community. The authors also cite how they would perceive success based on several small topics, that is, we have material to audit both progress and results.

      "The game works on top of one of the most famous technologies that involve the Cardano ecosystem: NFTS and CNFTS. As I understand it, it is a strategy game, where players (Pangaeans) would face challenges, trade NFT and transact in cryptocurrency. In this way, various parts of the Cardano ecosystem would be used and the objectives of the challenge would indeed be achieved, not least because all transactions (from what I understand) would be made on our blockchain. It is very positive as the author already has experience with NFT (according to him, he has 9 collections) and as he already has defined what would be the native token of the game: $PG(PangaeaToken). In my view, this experience is quite significant to shape the impact of the project, because the author already has some background with this technology and trying to align it with the objectives of the challenge (i.e., increase the number of transactions on our blockchain, NFT exchange , people who know and use Cardano) can bring great results. That is, the theory here is very good. However, I think it lacked detail in explaining the game itself. What would be the main goals of the players? What would a match be like? Would it be an online game? How players could profit from it (it is said that they could, but not explained exactly how). We have several similar projects trying to be financed or even already winners on Catalyst, I would like to know specifically what the differential of this one is. In this way, I would be more confident, as an AC, in classifying this proposal with a maximum grade.

How long would each of these activities take to complete? Who would be responsible for each of them? I believe that the information given is good, but it could be better if it were explained to us in what period of time exactly they would happen. Three months is a very long time, it would be better to divide the activities within this larger block into weeks, for example. Regarding the financial amount, a similar thing happens: we know how the total amount would be divided into large parts, but each of them could have been better explained. To cite the example of marketing: they ask for 10k for this, it is a very high value, it would be important for us to understand exactly what marketing strategies would be used, how the target audience would be approached, how long this process would take and who would be in the line of forward here. Because they are high values, the more detail there is, the better. And finally, the team presentation is the best developed part here. We know the names, roles and a little background of each team member; What I wanted, however, is that they had attached a linkedin profile or a website where we could see, demonstrably, the experience of each of them.

The team informs that it will distribute the tasks weekly (this could have been included in the previous topic, as I mentioned), that they will have a meeting (almost) every week and use online tools for work collaboration, in addition to creating graphics that allow a better visualization of the realization of these processes. Theoretically, this is perfect. The problem is that they seem like they intend to organize themselves among themselves, but it doesn't show that they intend to take it to the public. All these strategies and solutions would be ideal if everyone could see how things are going, that is, how would they expose such information to the Cardano community? It is essential that they think about how to bridge the gap between these internal organizations and the rest of us. I think it might be useful for them to publish these graphs on one of our various communication channels, who knows, at the end of their meetings, they would prepare reports that would be sent to the Cardano community. We know what your goals are, but they are quite broad, it would be more appropriate if the team set some more specific and objective goals, easier to verify (did this actually happen?). If the activities were organized in weeks and this organization was taken to the rest of the community, we could verify, in addition to the results, if the development of the project was also happening in an adequate way, that is, if each task was happening in the foreseen time and etc. \n",

      "I found an inconsistency in this proposal, as at the beginning the proposer says that the content will be translated into Assamese (\"Summarize your solution to the problem: Provide translated videos in Assamese about the Cardano ecosystem\") and then he made the lack of content in Hindi about Cardano (\"Lack of official Hindi content for Project Cardano. So Assamese speakers cannot learn in their native language\"). I did a brief research, as I am not from India, to identify if these two languages ​​are spoken in the country and in fact, both Assamese and Hindi are official languages ​​of India, but it would be necessary for the proposer to make it clear, after all, for which language he intends to translate this project. Now analyzing the scope of the project itself, the idea aligns well with the objectives of the challenge, because it proposes to translate content about our blockchain into a language accessible to Indians. First, I will highlight the positive points: the proponent makes it very clear what the KPIs are already in this section of the impact, I think this is good, because if we are clear about where we want to go and what should be done, the whole project is guided more safe. He also points out some challenges that may be faced along the way, and already proposes solutions, which demonstrates a lot of maturity and planning. However, I disagree with two points that have been raised: the proponent claims that Ada's volatility is a problem. In fact, it's not pleasant to see our money fluctuating so much, however this is a characteristic of cryptocurrencies, and it's something that affects all Catalyst projects, so I don't think it should be considered a problem especially in this case. It's a fact that we need to learn to deal with. And I also disagree when the proponent says that it is difficult and time consuming to convert Ada into the local currency, this can be done through exchanges like Binance, very simply and quickly, and it makes no difference which currency we are buying or selling. What is at stake is the delay in carrying out the transaction on the blockchain, but this is something that, once again, affects everyone. From a negative point of impact, I thought that the proponent should better detail what the translated subjects will be and how they will be presented. I believe that, at first, more general and introductory topics of the cryptographic world will be worked on, but it would be very important for this to be better defined. Therefore, my grade will be 3, as I think that the confusion about the language and the lack of specification on the subjects covered really shakes the confidence in the impact of this project. \n",

      "Starting with the script analysis: the accounts of how many videos will be released don't make much sense. It is said that the channel would already be launched with 6 videos, and that the goal is to post 1 video every 3 days. That way, there's no way at the end of 3 months to have only 10 to 20 videos there. Regarding the roadmap, the proponent explains what would be the work each month, but this information is somewhat superficial. In general, in the first month the team would come together and 120 minutes of video would be produced. In the second, partnerships would be established (with whom?) and the same amount of minutes of videos would be produced. In the third month, the information is basically the same. I really think that this roadmap deserved a better detail, we should have more information about the activities developed each month, for example, how the team would be assembled, how these partnership forms (how the proponent would establish an initial contact and also what your goals with it), how would the work routine of everyone involved so that the goal of 120 minutes of video was possible and etc. Talking about funding, I also think that this part should be better explained, starting with the values ​​of the translations themselves. It is very complicated to prove that the exact number of words that was promised was translated. Regarding, for example, the social media campaign, we do not know which media would be targeted and how this disclosure would be made, so it is not possible to understand whether the asking amount of 1500 dollars for this is fair or not. The same I say for contingency fee, it would be important for the author to explain what this is and why it would cost 2000 dollars. Now talking about the team, this is certainly the best part of the feasibility because we know a lot of details about each of those involved in the project. We know their names, we have access to their linkedin profiles and we are also provided with a good explanation of their CVs. So I think there's a lot of trust in the team.

In any case, it is quite possible to audit the development process of this project, as we have KPIs established from the very beginning. This auditability activity would be even better if the roadmap was better detailed. I think it is more appropriate for a member of the Cardano community who is Indian and available to do so, for this person to closely audit what is happening, all the individual activities of each month and also the results that are being achieved little by little. . In this way, monitoring the process would be very accurate. In the part of the auditability of the final results, again the proposer repeats things that have already been attached to the proposal. I think it is not established exactly how this initiative could be analyzed from a more human point of view, without being so based on numbers. I believe that it would be important for this team to research directly with the viewers of their youtube channel if they were actually getting involved with the Cardano ecosystem, what activities they were developing, what was the impact of these translations for them, etc. And it would also be important, of course, for us to know how all this interfered with the Cardano ecosystem, if the number of active members has increased, if more Indians are getting involved in Catalyst, using or even creating Dapps and etc. In other words, I think that the final auditability is already well underway by the metrics provided, but it should be better explored by qualitative aspects. \n",

      "Despite being simple, this proposal serves well what the challenge seeks. Our objective here is to fund innovative proposals that would attract new members to the Cardano community, be they future proponents, CAs, community mentors, etc.; and also encourage passive Ada holders to be more active in the community. These indicators can be measured in several ways, such as the number of digital wallets created, votes in the governance phase, etc. The idea here is to promote some face-to-face events, which would be held in places such as hotel auditoriums and convention centers, from what I understand, that have as content subjects that address the Cardano ecosystem, the differential and advantages of our blockchain. These meetings would take place in Brazil, in the cities of Brasília, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. They are targeted because they are some of the largest cities in the country, with a high number of entrepreneurs, potential investors and Catalyst proponents. The problems I identified here were about the detail of the idea. It is not clear how many events would be held in all, how the organizers would be able to captivate the target audience to go to the face-to-face meetings, without necessarily knowing anything about Cardano; how many people are expected per event; where these events would be in each city (the bidder cites Rotary Club and Mason Lodge, but I searched and didn't find exact locations for this, Rotary Club seems to be an association and Mason Lodge I really couldn't figure out what it is); and, mainly, which themes within Cardano's universe would be addressed, in which order and by whom. Knowing who the speakers would be would be essential to guarantee the success of the proposal, because I believe that in order to captivate a lay audience on the subject, we need people who are both experts in Cardano and charismatic enough to hold the public's attention, in addition to having a good didactic to teach in an accessible way from a young computer engineer to an older investor.

But it is not said in which cities they would be in which months, for example, month 1 in Rio de Janeiro, month 2 in Brasília and so on. Nothing is said about the pre-production process of the events, and no type of script is established for each event, if it would only consist of the lecture followed by a networking session with drinks, from what is understood. We don't know the average duration of these events, if it would last an entire afternoon/night, how many hours, etc. And in terms of expenses, some things I found a little disproportionate, 1400 USD is requested just for the rent of spaces, and since one dollar is approximately 5 reais, that would be 7000 reais for just one shift of space use, I think which is a very high value and does not correspond to what is charged in practice (I say this because I am Brazilian so I know the average rental price). The price of 500 USD for the lecture is also high, but then I don't know whether or not it would be disproportionate. Regarding the rest of the expenses, I believe everything is ok, it is possible to understand clearly what the requested money would be used for. And finally, with regard to the team, we are shown who each team member is and their main professional attributions, but it is not specified what exactly they would do in the project. The description of each is, in my opinion, very short, they could have detailed more about their resumes, even if they have attached their linkedin profiles, the information about each involved is still very superficial in the proposal itself. In other words, in general, I think that the absence of a script itself, a very brief description of those involved and some doubts about the need for the budget (for example in the price of rents) make me think that the feasibility is ok, but There's a lot to improve too. \n",

      "I think measuring whether this project is being successful is even simple, as the proponent suggests, most of these results could be understood based on the number of event participants and creation of digital wallets. This is enough for us to understand if the event itself was a success, but it would be possible to go further in monitoring the proposal. Basic data from the participants could be collected, such as their email or telephone number, and the proponent could carry out a survey after the events, in order to find out how these people are in relation to Cardano. Have they become active participants in our community? Are you participating in Catalyst, whether as proponents, CAs, voters? Bought and delegated Adas? Did they somehow spread the knowledge obtained on the day of the event to third parties? I think that with a small questionnaire with those who participated, the impact of these events on our blockchain could be measured more deeply, we could understand if the impact had the desired depth. Other than that, I think that any member of the community, who lived in the cities that would host the events, should participate and provide feedback to the rest of us on how the day of the event itself went, if everything went as planned, if the people interacted well and made contacts, exchanging experiences and so on. In other words, according to the proponent, it is possible to audit the proposal, but this could be done with even more quality through other initiatives. \n",

      "Unfortunately, I have my doubts about how much this idea will add so much to the Cardano ecosystem. Starting with the fact that the proposer intends to create a channel on youtube, where we already have a good base of content about Cardano and also a considerable amount of viewers. As I see it, this challenge aims to release videos, photos, audios and other forms of media on platforms other than those on which we already have a strong base. The idea is to reach other, more traditional media, such as television and radio, for example, in order to have access to a different audience, which would be the people who would consume content on these alternative platforms. I think that for even more money to be invested in the creation of content for youtube, it is necessary that the project is very well structured, that we know exactly what would be done and that this was very positive and differentiated for our blockchain. The idea here is to create a series of videos that address topics related to permaculture. I think it would be necessary for the proponent to better conceptualize what area of ​​study this is, I did some research on the outside to understand what it is about, since I had never heard of the term. In short, it is something that relates to ecology and how society can organize itself in alternative ways. The proponent defines some subjects that would be addressed in the channel: “Ethics in Permaculture, Sustainable Design Principles, Blockchain solutions, sustainable practices, alternative societies, off-grid solutions”. The problem is that the content seems to be much more about design, permaculture and sustainability than blockchain. It is unclear how the proponent will impart knowledge about Cardano, he says he will cite blockchain practices, but where would our blockchain specifically fit in here? When talking about this technology, the impression that is given is that the proponent would generally explain what it is about and focus on use cases. However, it is essential that the contents created make clear the specific characteristics of Cardano, what is the difference between our blockchain and the others, what are the advantages (even ecological) found in Cardano. I would like to know which exact topics would be covered on this, as there are several, from the most general (what is blockchain, what are cryptocurrencies, what is Cardano and etc) to the most specific (how to propose to Catalyst, which language of blockchain programming, such as programming for smart contracts and etc). The proponent even mentions what topics will be covered, but the quote is superficial, even though he has given the example of how he would explain what smart contracts are. Finally, my opinion is that it is not clear how Cardano will be portrayed in this channel, the percentage of videos that would be dedicated to our blockchain in relation to the other subjects mentioned, which specific subjects would be addressed, etc.; therefore, not much confidence is given in the impact of this proposal. \n",

      "We have a roadmap attached, but I thought the proponent should have explained the proposed activities for each period of weeks. He cites what will be done, but does not detail the activities. For example, in the first week, “Building the team and forming alliances”, how will this be done? We see in the part of the team presentation that he has already defined the professionals involved in the project, but in relation to alliances: with whom does he intend to try to establish them? And how will you make that contact? What exactly is he looking for with such alliances? As in this week, the others should be better explained, in week four, for example, the proponent intends, together with his team, to start producing the videos. How would this process take place? Which professionals would be involved in this part of the project, and what tasks would they perform exactly? The script is ok, but not deep enough for us to have a solid visualization of the process. Regarding the division of the budget, 35 thousand dollars are requested for the project, a value that I found quite expensive, because we don't know how many videos would be produced in total (I believe there are 24, since the project would last 12 weeks and the each of them 2 videos would be released, but this information would need to be confirmed). The way in which the money would be used, however, is well explained, we know well how the total would be distributed. The proponent explains this division into a few parts and within those parts he even delimits what exactly the expenses would be, for example, for “Video Production Equipment: $9,500” the expenses would specifically be for the rental of “A-cam: Body of 4K Full-Frame camera, a set of 2 lenses (prime and zoom), a more economically priced B-Cam, professional-grade 3-point lighting system, monitor-recorder, an A-cam filming rig and mounts tripods and miscellaneous equipment”. My suggestion that would serve to further improve this part of the proposal would be for the proponent to say how much each of these pieces of equipment would cost to rent. If he specified how much each of the little things within those larger parts would cost, I think the budget explanation would be flawless. However, it's still good the way it is. Finally, analyzing the team, I think this part was superficial as well as the script, because all we know are the names of the team members and also the roles that they would be assigned. However, more detail is necessary, such as, for example: to know a little about their previous experiences, in other words, the curriculum of each one. Where did they study, where did they work before? it would also be very important for us to know if they have any previous experience with Cardano, we know that Vinay Deva is an expert in blockchain, but is it specialized in our blockchain or another? Anyway, more details should have been provided about the team. In summary, my opinion is that only the budget is well explained, with both the script and the team needing more details. \n",

      "I believe that the proponent already has a good idea of ​​how the auditability of this project would be possible. Regarding the development process, he divides this analysis into 3 parts, explaining what would have to be monitored in each. I think the explanations are about both the tasks to be performed (such as going after equipment rental) and the small goals (partial results) to be achieved, as in phase 3: “promote the content to maximum reach” . The question here would only be how to make so much information within easy and practical reach of the entire Cardano community. Will any online document sharing tool be used, such as Notion, Miro or Google Docs? Could it be that at the end of each of the aforementioned phases, the proponent and his team would prepare a report, gathering the main information, advances and difficulties encountered in that period of time? It is necessary that such a report be produced (it can be written, or recorded, it is at the team's discretion) and that it be freely available for any members of our community to have access to it and be able to exercise auditability in a constant and safe way. The ideal would be for someone who understands sustainability/permaculture to audit the project and maintain contact with the Cardano community, this would make the auditability process more practical and simple. Regarding the final results, I also think the proponent suggests very good ways to monitor the results, both quantitatively (e.g. he aims for the channel to “Get 1000+ YouTube subscribers with 4000+ watch hours”) and qualitatively (Establish a similar presence on at least 3 other social media channels and 1 other video sharing platform for maximum reach). I think that a direct survey could be carried out with the channel's subscribers, with the objective of understanding how they are using the knowledge that was acquired with the hours watched on the channel. In other words, in what ways are they getting involved with the blockchain universe, if they have become active members of the community and if so, in what way, in what activities of the Cardano ecosystem they are currently involved and etc. All information collected in this final phase should also be easily accessible to members of the Cardano community, as I also suggested in the partial results part, on any of the various communication platforms available. \n",

      "I think the proponent failed to better explain the problem situation that needs to be resolved, we are told that “Pastoral Maasai are denied the right to an identity card for years due to punitive verification procedures imposed on them”, however, that punitive procedures these are? What exactly happens to these communities? From what I understand, the process of generating identity is bureaucratic and there is no political interest for them to solve it, “because they use the identification situation to move voters to areas where they are likely to increase the number of votes”. However, the explanation of this situation is still quite superficial and somewhat confusing. I wish the proponent had provided longer and more detailed explanations of this issue and how our blockchain technologies could help solve it. From what I understand, DIDs would be created for these people, however not much security is passed on how they would be instructed to use them, we also don't know what the situation is there regarding access to technology. Do these people have access to cell phones, computers, tools that allow them to access and manage decentralized identities? If they do, how would these communities be taught how to handle DIDs, what advantages would they gain from this over traditional identities issued by their country? It is not very certain that these people will be educated to use DIDs and how this will benefit them, because if they are a pastoralist community, we are led to think that they live in rural areas and probably do not have as much access to technology. In my opinion, it is not valid to promote a project that does not dialogue with the cultural and behavioral characteristics of a certain people, we do not know to what extent these communities will accept using DIDs, what would be their opinion and reaction to the project. It would be necessary for the proponent to explain all this, how this project would be useful in the practical life of the target audience (in this case, these pastoral communities). I'm also not sure when to what extent this proposal aligns with the objectives of the challenge, because our intention here is to disseminate content about Cardano in different media from which we already have a good base (such as youtube), in order to make these contents reach new audiences, different from those who consume the platforms already used. It is not clear where this documentary would be shown, nor how this project could help new people to get to know Cardano, what seems to me to be the intention here is to make more people aware of the situation in these communities; and not the wide dissemination of our blockchain and its technologies and differentials. Therefore, I have serious doubts about the impact of this project, both for the Cardano ecosystem and for the communities involved. \n",

      "The script provided is quite superficial, at first we only know which activities would be developed, without any in-depth explanations about them. On the part of auditability, we also have a temporal notion of when each of these activities is expected to be carried out (May 2022 Plan the dates for the interview / June 2022 Conduct interview scripts / June 2022 Filming and recording / etc). However, I think that it would be necessary for this information to be made available on feasibility, that is, that in addition to the proponent saying what would need to be done, we should also already place ourselves in that part of the proposal when such things would have to be done. In addition, as I mentioned, each activity should have been better explained, details should have been provided about each one, so that the understanding of the process was more solid. For example, “Conducting interviews with filming and recording”: who would be interviewed? How many interviews would there be? How would the interviewees be approached, how would they be captivated to participate in the process? How much time is planned for the recording process of each interview? Would respondents receive some sort of reward, whether financial or otherwise, for participating in this project? Unfortunately, the notion of process that is passed on to us is quite incomplete, not generating much understanding of the daily work that would need to be developed for the proposal to leave theory and become reality. Regarding the budget, I think the asking price is quite fair and compatible with the project, in terms of the salary of the professionals involved (photographer, editor, sound manager, etc.), the only thing I could suggest is that in addition to how much they would receive we were also told how many hours of work they would dedicate to this project. That way, we would have an idea of ​​the price of your work hour and we could have a more accurate view of whether this value would be fair or not. Now, other parts such as the value used for travel and accommodation should be better explained, in my opinion. In terms of travel, who would travel, from where and to where, how many people, how long would they be traveling? The accommodation, in the same way, would be for how many people and for how long? Finally, in relation to the team, I think the presentation was not done in the most adequate way, although it was not bad. A summary is given about who this team would be and also their linkedin profiles, where we could check their previous experiences and get to know them in practice. However, the ideal would be to have an individual explanation about each one, containing their names, roles in the project, a summary of their past experiences and if they have any kind of relationship with Cardano. Therefore, I think the project's viability is average, with positive points but also a lot of things to be improved. \n",

      "Regarding the auditability of this proposal, my suggestion is that the proposer creates reports at the end of each month, as it clearly defines what will have to be done in each month, that is, we know what to monitor, the question is how this information will be achieved by the Cardano community. For example, in May, important people would be identified, but how could the community audit this process? I think that a bridge between the work that will be done and the members of our ecosystem is not clear, this bridge could be given through a summary of what was actually done, the work routine of those involved, if the monthly goals were reached, if there were problems and how they were overcome, etc. In my view, the way the proponent reports on the auditability of the process says a lot about the goals, but not about the tasks to be performed in order for these goals to be achieved. Using the same example from the month of May, we know that the objective is to select the interviewees, but what would the team have to do in the pre-production of this? Travel, accommodation, contacting interview candidates, a number of things, do you agree? All this should come to the knowledge of the Cardano community. Therefore, I suggest that the proponent organize a monthly report and make it available directly to the community, it could be on some discord channel in the Cardano community aimed at monitoring proposals financed by this fund. Finally, talking about the final results, I think the proponent did not provide a good explanation of the success. What he basically wants is the main product, that this documentary be recorded and released, but that's not enough for us to understand the impact of the project. We would also need to know two main things: a) how did this documentary impact the Cardano ecosystem? Were DIDs actually created for the members of the communities in question? How has this all helped popularize our blockchain? b) how the communities were benefited, what was the real impact on their daily lives, what benefits are they having from now on, how are they managing their DIDs, if they learned about Cardano and so on. Once these two issues are explored and the results of such research are made available to the Cardano community, I would say that the auditability is complete and adequate. Unfortunately, as presented to us, this part of the proposal still needs a lot of improvement. \n",

      "The proposal is very confusing, we are told that all existing hubs would be brought together so that together they can more effectively boost the popularization of the Cardano ecosystem. However, it is not explained how this connection process between the hubs would be, what would happen after they were connected, who would command which activities in favor of the expansion of our blockchain. My perception is that this proposal seems to be an idea at an early stage, which could be very promising, but in the way it is described, little is known about what the proposer plans to develop. This challenge aims to popularize the Cardano ecosystem for a specific community; at the end of reading the proposal, we are told that these hubs would come from Kenya. In this case, that would be the target community. However, it is not described what would happen or even how future activities would respect and dialogue with the specific characteristics of this audience, therefore, the objectives of the challenge are very uncertain. In terms of barriers, the proponent cites several problems to be overcome: “lack of genuine software, inadequate computer in the classroom, low speed internet, lack of motivation on the teacher and student side to use ICT, lack of of adequate training, unavailability of the latest ICT equipment, lack of specialized technical personnel, poor administrative support”. But how will this all be resolved? He points out the problems, but not the solutions.

The proponent would need to explain in detail what activities would lead to the development of these objectives. The time division is adequate as the bidder breaks down what would happen each month. From the way the project development process is presented to us, it is not possible to understand how these activities would gradually be built, how phases would be developed, in short, how the gradual process of carrying out the project would be. All we have is an overview of the process. The budget is also not well explained, only 1500 dollars are requested, but when explaining the project's expenses, parts are mentioned that add up to much more than that. We know that the budget would be divided into such parts, as: “One exhibition of Cardano and Catalyst (Cardano day)”. What would that show look like? What would be shown? How would the target audience be attracted? Because that would cost 2 thousand dollars (a single part is already over the requested budget, I think there was a confusion here). All parts needed to be better explained and detailed, so that we had an accurate understanding of the need for such investments. And finally, speaking of the team, this is the best part of feasibility, because basic data about those involved are informed, such as: their full names, professional areas, examples of previous work, how their relationship with the ecosystem is Cardano (as in the example of Angela who knows Plutus) and their linkedin profiles, where we can see in practice what jobs they have done before. I suggest that the bidder review the feasibility, increasing the detail in the roadmap portion and clarifying the expense issue, only the team presentation is adequate. \n",

It would also be interesting for them to report not only the partial results, but also how their work routines were in the respective months. Were there problems, was something missing? But in general, I liked the auditability of the progress, I think that part of the proposal is well specified. Now regarding the final success, basically nothing is said, just that they aim to reach 30 hubs in Kenya. Okay, we know from impact that this is the goal. But how could we monitor if all hubs were actually reached? Would a list be made of the connected hubs, of the activities they would be developing? Would an analysis be made of how this project has impacted the Cardano community from Kenya in practice? Unfortunately, once again the information is confusing and superficial. I do not agree that this proposal is easily auditable in terms of the final results, as the information given to us is very abstract, very broad. I will give it 3 stars because one part is adequate (process) and the other is inadequate (success scenario), making it necessary for the proponents to adjust this, in order to improve this last topic of analysis. \n",

      "I thought this idea was very good and in my opinion it aligns perfectly with the objectives of the challenge. In this challenge, we aim to finance projects that help developing countries/communities, and one of the ways to do this is environmental, as is the case with the proposal. With the success of this project, rare trees from Africa will be protected; the idea can be summed up in creating an NFT (called NFTtree) that will give its holder a series of information about a specific rare tree, such as photos, videos, the power to choose how it will be treated (obviously, within basic prerequisites), among other things like “information about each species, such as local name, time of seed availability, any special history surrounding them and much more”. I thought this is analogous to having a virtual pet, which in this case would be a real-life tree. I think this idea could be very successful for both NFT enthusiasts and environmental activists who want to help preserve the environment. In other words, here we have the potential to dialogue with different audiences, and if the people who acquire these NFTs minted on the Cardano blockchain are unaware of our ecosystem and its technologies, this would certainly be a great way to spread it to a new audience. In my opinion, some more information could have been provided, such as which rare tree species we are talking about, where would these farms be that they will manage, how often will there be updates on the tree information (your growth, reproduction, appearance of fruits, parasites, etc.), what would be the approximate value of one of these NFTs... Finally, details, which, if provided, would serve to richly complement the understanding of the proposal. The impact of the proposal will certainly be positive and it meets the requirements of the challenge well, as the proposers explain how the money from the sale of these NFTs would be used: for the expansion of cultivation farms and for the benefit of local communities that gave some kind of support to the project. In other words, in addition to having an environmental impact, this proposal will also be of a social nature, both in terms of benefiting nearby communities and by raising general awareness in schools and those who have contact with this project. This all increases even more the degree of positive impact it will generate in the chosen locations! It is very good that the proponents explain in this topic, in general, which phases would constitute the project, because that way we can visualize it well. \n",

      "The feasibility of the project is good, but it can still improve in some aspects. Speaking of the phases, the proponents explain how many steps there would be and what would be done mainly in each of them. My observations here are as follows: there could be a temporal notion, that is, we should be informed 1) in which month of the year each stage is located 2) how long is expected for these activities to last, from start to finish. It would also be interesting to provide a more in-depth explanation of some things, such as, for example, in step zero, travel and research would be done. As I mentioned in Impact, it would be positive if the proponents said which countries and communities they would visit, which tree species they are thinking of working on the project and so on. In step two they talk about expanding the current nursery they have, I would like to know more about it. How many trees do they already grow, what species, how many new trees do they intend to acquire here? Anyway, more detail and a better notion of temporality would be very beneficial. Now, in relation to the budget, I think the asking value is totally fair, in my view it is a very complex proposal and a project that will probably be extensive and will require a lot of effort from the team involved. Therefore, the $27,000 requested as funding is a very acceptable amount. About it, we know which parts would be divided and how much each of them will take the total amount. I think from the way this explanation is done, we already have a good understanding of the use of money, but as with the script, a little more detail would be welcome. $3,000 is requested for travel logistics and coordination. How many people would travel, how many trips would there be, what would be the final and initial destination, how long would these people be traveling? In the part of “Seeds and seedlings (acquisition and conditioning): $9000”, approximately how many seeds would be acquired at this stage? We know the amount of seedlings that were aimed at the end of 6 and 12 months, but we don't know if they would all be purchased with these 9k. And how much would go for acquisition, and how much for conditioning? Without knowing an approximate amount of seeds, we don't know the price of the unit, and that doesn't allow us to be an idea if this part is expensive or not. I'm also not sure who would get that money. Who would the sellers be? Probably the communities that inhabited the places where these trees would currently be planted. And finally, when it comes to the team, a drive is available, I tried to access it but it needs permission. However, this is not so much of a problem as we have good information about the teams. We know their names, a small resume of each and their linkedins, where we can have proof of the information said. From what I could observe, only Megan is associated with the Cardano ecosystem. In my opinion, the more people the better, but one is enough. In summary, I think the proposal is very viable, this part of the project is very satisfactory, although not perfect. \n",

      "The proposal is quite auditable, in my opinion, the proponents outline great ways to monitor both the project development process and the final results. What remains to be desired is how all this information would reach the community. Speaking more specifically about the project construction process: the documents that will be made available on github (after 3 months) are used as indicators of success of the partial results, how many trees will be planted in a time of 6 and 12 months after funding, whitepaper publication and finishing of the coining platform and etc. I think it would be interesting for the team, at the end of each stage, to gather the information available so far, about all this, in some online data sharing platform, which should be made available to the entire Cardano community. As this proposal would require several forms of monitoring, I think that a written report would not be the most efficient way to audit the steps, in my view, tools like Notion or Miro, which allow the attachment of both written documents, videos and images, could better address the needs of the project. And in relation to the final results, all the suggested indicatives could be summarized both in a text, which could be made available on the same online platform previously selected, and there could be an audiovisual content production that showed in video form the tree farm at the end of the year. project. Testimonies from nearby communities could also be recorded, as well as how the NFTs would be working (what information would be contained in them), how their owners would be learning about the species they “own”. A summary could also be made of how the project was extended to schools, so that the educational nature it contains could also be explored. All of this together could form a short video to be shown at Town Hall, and not just at our official community meeting; In my view, this video would have the potential to generate marketing for Cardano, we could use it as a way to demonstrate that our blockchain has environmental and social goals to be achieved, going beyond a purely economic logic. This is also related to the audiovisual challenge, launched in this fund, and could be a great promotional material for Cardano. Therefore, I think that the proponents suggest different and efficient ways of auditing the project, what remained pending was just clarifying how all this would reach the knowledge of the Cardano community. \n",

      "In my opinion, this proposal is well aligned with the objectives of the challenge. We know that here we are looking to fund Dapps that can, in some way, promote the expansion of the Cardano ecosystem. This would clearly be done through the “Youblob” platform. It is a kind of youtube, but totally focused on sharing projects in which people would do with their own hands and materials that were within their reach various products (such as DIY, do it yourself, the famous DIY). Content creators could market manuals, as I understand it, in NFTs format. The content created would be sold, purchases could be made, revenue generated and incentives made for their favorite creators (at least that was my interpretation of the activities that would make up the platform). The proponent explains very well about which parts would form the application and how it would work, that is, what would be the user experience. We know that accounts would be registered, and each account would be automatically linked to a digital wallet. Transactions would be done through smart contracts, and there would be artificial intelligence guiding the user experience. Fees of 5% would be charged on top of the value of each sale, so that artificial intelligence could be maintained and progressively evolved. In general, these would be the platform activities. I found it a very interesting and different proposal, focusing on a very specific audience, and that can organically attract new members to the Cardano community; after all, people would not come for the blockchain, but for the tutorials. It would be interesting for the proponent to explain how these users would be instructed in the use of technologies relevant to Cardano. How will they know how to use their digital wallets, how will they transact on the blockchain? It is not so clear whether payments would only be by native tokens or could be made in Ada, for example. But anyway, I really agree that Dapp is of high value and could achieve the specific goals of the challenge, such as increasing NFTs in circulation, (probably) increasing the volume of Ada being sent, number of new smart contracts being done, more people becoming active members of our community and so on. I think the differential of the proposal is, in addition to being very focused on a target audience, it was so well explained both in terms of user experience and the technologies that would be adopted here in relation to Cardano (which are several). Therefore, I will give full marks for the impact, because in terms of the benefits that this project can generate for Cardano, I think they can be really significant. \n",

It is said that the whole process would take 6 to 9 months, but why is this time so variable? I think it would be much better for the author to indicate in which month the project would start and what would be planned for each succeeding month. The level of detail of the activities could also be better delved into, for example in “make a more user-friendly UI/UX in alignment with smart contract integration”; how would that be done? How many people would work here and for how long? How would the platform be created, what design requirements would be studied so that the UI/UX was more user-friendly and ergonomic? How long, more or less, would this activity take to be developed? In fact, the whole process is described by just 4 activities, which are mentioned in a very generic way. I would like the level of specificity of the script to be higher, it is not possible to have a good understanding of what will happen based on the information given. Now talking about the budget, $22,500 is asked, this part is really in need of a good revamp. All we know is whether the money would go towards the salaries of PHP and Plutus developers. But we don't know 1) how many developers would work 2) what their work routines would be like 3) the value of their monthly salaries 4) how many hours they would dedicate each month to the project, whether they would work full-time or part-time. I also wonder, will the designer mentioned in the script not be paid? The project will not have a form of marketing? How will the target audience be aware of its existence? Unfortunately, this part leaves something to be desired, requiring a lot of detail to be included. The team presentation part also leaves a lot to be desired, because we don't actually have professionals being presented here. We know that a Plutus developer, a business developer (designated by IOG) and “Atala Prism people” (developers too?) would be needed to compose the team. And the designer and the publicist? We only know what functions would be necessary but we are not presented with names, resumes, as we do not know who would be involved, we also have no way of knowing about their previous experiences, nor how they relate to our blockchain (if they are experienced in dealing with the technologies from Cardano). As a whole, the feasibility is very superficial, there is no confidence in the process, how the money would be used or the team (as it is not yet formed). My suggestion is that this topic be completely reworked. \n",

      "Regarding the auditability of progress, the proponent states that it would be done “through tasks jora and test spira”. What are those things? Are they auditing methods? He says they will also measure traffic, transactions and different elements of interaction. But how would these things be measured? And how would the results be made available to the Cardano community? Unfortunately, all the established metrics are a bit confusing, I can't properly understand how the project development process would be done. I think that, first of all, it would be necessary for the script to be improved. By that, I mean both in terms of temporality (that the tasks were divided into months) and the level of detail of the process (only 4 tasks make up all the explanations about the process, which I think is quite inadequate, it would be necessary for us to understand solidly everything that would be done and how those things would be done). In the following excerpts “3-6 months: Implementation of the new design, along with initial smart contract functionality and light wallet” and “6-9 months: Extended smart contract functionality which Adaptive payments from external vendor currently can not handle, along with NFT handling on Blueprints”, we can see what the short and medium term goals would be. This is already good material that could be monitored. Now, it would be necessary for the proponent to make this information verifiable for the entire Cardano community in a very practical and accessible way. Finally, analyzing the final results, we know what would be considered a success for part of the system, for the traffic of the platform and also how the project could evolve to the next level. Fortunately, this part is much better covered. We have a lot of material to monitor. We know what would need to be achieved in relation to Dapp. However, it is necessary for the proponent to also clarify how the consequences for our blockchain can be easily measurable. How can we see if the specific objectives of the challenge have been achieved? It would be necessary for both quantitative and qualitative data to be measured and forwarded directly and simply to the entire Cardano community. Therefore, I think auditability is average, presenting strengths and others that fall short (mainly on progress). \n",

      "The proposal dialogues with various technologies relevant to the Cardano ecosystem, such as DAOs, issuance of NFTs, Atala Prism DIDs and etc. However, it's still a little confusing as to how this project will actually drive greater adoption of our blockchain, but let's go in pieces. The idea is to create a community (Proud Dirt Farmers - PDF), which would be a kind of group whose main objective is to “encourage family farms to reduce carbon”. This would be done through a reward system, each farmer would have a decentralized Atala Prism identity through which their data would be associated. They would receive what was called by the proponents a “cardano credit bond”, which could be sold, as I understand it. Proponents also say they plan to go further. For example, they want to form a conscious community that thinks about “food security, the importance of farm-based carbon sequestration” and other sustainability issues. In theory, it's all very interesting; we know that several aspects of our ecosystem, as I mentioned at the beginning of the analysis, would be used. This makes us think that, then, Cardano would be boosted, fostered and benefited in many ways. However, I identify some problems here. For starters: would these DAOs be face-to-face or online? How would farmers and smallholders be invited to the project? How would it be publicized, and how would these workers be educated in a simple way about what Cardano, blockchain and etc is? In addition to the teachings on sustainability, how would the more technical parts be explained in an understandable way, accessible to all? What would these carbon bonds be? How would they help reduce the amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere? What would farmers have to provide for these credits to be issued? How would they receive them, and how would they handle them? Would it be through digital wallets? How would the Atala Prism DIDs be associated, could the worker receive the credits only if they have these decentralized identities? I think that several questions are said but not properly explained, that is, many questions remain open. I understood what needed to be done, but not how, it is not so clear how a project of such complexity would develop in practice. Therefore, my opinion is that the idea is undoubtedly very good, but there are many instances relevant to Cardano involved and it is not so clear how all this would develop, what the process of receiving the credits would be like, how the workers would be entitled to this. , how they would be instructed to use them and how their real impact would be measured. Therefore, I will give it a score of 3, my opinion is neutral, the core of the proposal is great but it should be better explained (in terms of practical realization). \n",

      "I did not find the provided script suitable. Starting with the fact that the temporal division is a little confusing, what would 1.T1 / 2.T2 / 3.Q2 be? In my view, it would be more appropriate for the proponents to have broken down the entire script into months. It is the simplest and most practical way, and with the appropriate degree of specificity, to understand the temporality of processes. Speaking now about the activities, they are only mentioned, they are not explained. We don't understand in detail what would be done, how it would be done and who would do it. For example, in “Formation of the foundation and social acquisition”, how would the foundation be formed? In this case, would the participants who would compose the DAO be called here? How would they be selected and how would the proponent present the project to them, their motivations and ultimate goals? What would social acquisition be? In “Subject to the Roadmap - Takeoff DAO”, it is not very clear what would happen, but I infer that it would be the growth and popularization of this DAO. How would this expansion be successful? Would some sort of publicity campaign be launched, how would the target audience be reached? In general, I think that the script does not have the necessary degree of specificity so that we can solidly understand what would need to be done, so I would like it to be elaborated again, clarifying the issue of temporality better and increasing the degree of description of each of the activities. Turning now to the financing analysis, approximately 50 thousand dollars are requested; it is not a small amount, in fact it corresponds to about 10% of the money destined for the challenge. I disagree that the amount has been adequately explained, it is also generally lacking in detail. In “20,000 Legal Review, Compliance, and Foundation Setup. Third-party retention and fee-based estimates”, how much would you go for each thing? What would third-party retention be, what rates was this value based on? In “2,000 Acquisition of Socials and Initial Web Design”, are proponents referring to creating artwork to be posted on social media? Which social networks would be adopted in this publicity campaign, and this value corresponds only to the initial design, how would this part of the proposal continue to be maintained? I think it would need the topics to be explained more deeply, some parts are better than others (eg the “4,000 artist fees for initial NFT design work, logo design and social graphics part. Two weeks / 80 hours at 50 hours”, it is positive as the proponents state the price of the working hour in this case). But all, in my view, deserved the same level of detail. Regarding the team, this is undoubtedly the most elaborate part of the feasibility, since we have a lot of information about each of those involved in the project and links that can prove what was said. However, none of the team members is specialized in Cardano, which worries me a little, because I think it is always necessary that at least one person is well understood about the technologies of our blockchain. So I think the feasibility is ok, not bad, but we still have a lot of points to improve. \n",

      "Unfortunately, the proponents seem to be uncertain as to how the auditability of the process will be done. We know that it would be started more intensively in phase 2 of the project, “when the organization is funded, it is selling NFTs, it has a Treasury, the DAO is started and we turn to the real mission – to help family farms, globally, to kidnap carbon, help Mother Earth”. However, it is clear that the bidders do not have specific KPIs and metrics, from the excerpt “How do we audit this? At this point, anything we write will just be a questionable pope. We are aware of the issue, we recognize that it will need to be resolved, but at this point we are not close enough to have a solution. As Dor said, the solution will unfold over time!” It would be necessary for proponents to devise more direct ways to monitor the process and partial results. By that, I mean both the task accomplishment part and the small goals achieved. The process should be monitored at least every month, as I suggested in the topic above, it would be more appropriate if the temporality were divided in a more traditional and simple way - monthly, at least - and at the end of each of these cycles the team would need to the Cardano community about the project as a whole. Due to the fact that it is a project with several aspects, my suggestion is that it be divided into some parts. The parts I thought of were 1) direct guidance from farmers - how we're going to educate them about everything that's going to happen next 2) the mitigation of active tokens 3) the organization of the DAO itself 4) the creation and association of the DIDs of the Atala Prism for the rest of the project 4) the carbon credits emitted 5) the environmental consequences that could be measured, quantitatively and qualitatively. I think all these aspects should be monitored frequently. As the proponents themselves claim that they will use social networks to publicize the project, it would be interesting if small illustrative posts were made available monthly, with new information each month on each of these aforementioned fronts. Regarding the final results, it is quite complex to measure the success of a project with so many aspects, but I think that in general two things should be analyzed: the environmental impacts and the improvement of Cardano. The benefit to farmers could indeed be measured through “a self-sufficient treasury with inflation provisions that is able to reward farmers around the world for sustainability and carbon reduction”. The direct consequences for Cardano can be perceived based on the NFTs market and also by the “Atala-based SSI for a) farmer integration, b) agricultural carbon credit certification, c) ecobasket/ecobond to sell on the market to finance credits of carbon for farmers”. I thought that this part of auditability is better covered than the previous one. We have material on which we can build if success has been achieved; I missed an environmental measurement, that is, knowing how CO2 emissions actually reduced from this project. That part could be added. As long as the Cardano community is fully informed of all possible achievements (this could be done through a video participation in Town Hall, for example), I think the end results are already well measured. In other words, the auditability of the process leaves a lot to be desired, but the final success is adequate. \n",

      "I found this proposal very interesting and extremely relevant. It differs from most of the proposals found in this challenge, because most of the ideas are about introducing the cryptographic universe to the African population, instructing them, providing free courses, scholarships, etc. I think this is very important, as we know that blockchain is still a relatively unknown technology for most people on the continent, being more popular in the United States and Europe, for example. However, it is necessary that we have proposals of a more technical nature, with more specific objectives, as is the example of this one. The idea is to create a platform that works with the issue of data provision/access, with a lot of quality and security, where users (whether individuals, public or private organizations) have a lot of control over what is accessible and what is blocked. in relation to your data. I found that the way the application was explained was very accessible. In other words, we were able to clearly understand how the activities of this platform would work: they can be done in mobile applications or on the web, users would have two ways to provide their data specifically for a certain category (the so-called spontaneous submission of data) or by creating a form that can be viewed upon request... Anyway, everything that says about what would be done and what the user experience would be like is very clear to the proposal's readers. With this, I can clearly visualize the results of the project, which would be to create an “accessible and reliable way of collecting, curating and sharing data”. The proponent says that this issue of data sharing and research in relation to this is one of the most important and targeted issues in the development of the African continent, according to the African Union, so the project would work with a key issue, very relevant to the locality. With this, we can conclude that the proposal would have a high impact for the African continent, benefiting it, since it would address one of the main current demands there, clearly achieving the objectives of the challenge of promoting African economic and social development. And in relation to how all this could benefit Cardano, from what I understand all the data would be recorded on our blockchain, smart contracts would be made, to access some parts of the application (such as the data of someone/some company that they chose to keep the blocked information) people would have to make payments in Ada and etc. To conclude my opinion, I think that this proposal would have a very positive impact on our ecosystem and meets the objectives of the challenge very well. \n",

      "Unfortunately, that part of the proposal is not as good as the impact. Starting with the script, we know what tasks will be performed and how many weeks on average they would take to complete. However, I think the detail here should be more in-depth, so that we have a more solid understanding of the development process for this application. I will give an example: in addition to how many weeks each activity will last, the proponent could have placed us on when it would start (in which month) and when it would end. For example, in the case of “Technical Recruitment Team = 6 weeks”, would this start to be developed in May and end in June? If he had explained this issue of temporality better, at what time of year each thing would develop, I think we would have a better understanding of how long the project would take as a whole. It is also unclear whether each task would be done uniquely and when finished the team would move on to the next one or if some activities could be worked on at the same time, by the same or different people. Regarding the explanation of the budget, a very high amount of 140k USD is requested, I think that due to the complexity of the project this amount of money may even be necessary, but it is not understood very well why. This amount is divided into two parts, the first being the team salary and the contract fee. How much would go to wages, and how much would go to fees? In terms of salaries, how would this be shared across the entire team? Would everyone involved receive the same amount, or some less and some more, depending on their training and previous professional experience? How long will each professional work on the project? What will your work routine be like, would each one work every working day, and for how many hours? If this information had been provided, we would have had a better understanding of how the money would be used for the salary issue. As it is presented to us, this data is still a bit abstract. The value of 35k would be used for various things that involve distribution, again reinforcement: it would be interesting to know how much would go to one of the aforementioned parts: “Server and Database, Token Release, Promotion, Release”. Now speaking of the team, we know what kind of professionals would be working here, but we don't know details about them. In fact, we don't have information that allows us to know this team in a basic way, because we don't know their names, we don't know their professional resume, how they got involved with the Cardano ecosystem, we don't have social media profiles like linkedin, where we could get to know them in practice... We don't know who these experienced iCog Labs developers are. Therefore, I think that the feasibility of the proposal has a lot to improve and deserves to be reviewed. \n",

      "Project auditability is good, although not perfect. We can work here on two sides: that of the development process and that of the final results. Regarding the development process, it is said that progress would be made available in an online project management tool, such as Trello, for example, in addition to github. If these platforms are constantly updated and freely accessible so that any member of the Cardano community can access them at any time, I think the auditability of the process will be well ensured. Regarding the final results, we know what the specific objectives are for a period of time considered shorter and a longer one. It is positive how this information is passed on, as it generates a very solid view of what is desired as a result of this project. However, I would like to make a few more suggestions. The objectives are the complete development of the application, in addition to some quantitative goals such as more than five thousand users in the first year, more than a thousand spontaneous data submission entries and so on. Indeed, it is necessary for us to have knowledge of these numerical facets, but I also think it is important that we know what the qualitative impact of the whole thing was. It would be nice if the proponent, together with some key members of the team, could establish contact with some recurring users of the application to analyze if everything is working properly, for them to carry out general research in order to understand if the issue of data access , once a major problem for the target audience, is being performed satisfactorily. Whether this facet of African development is indeed being improved and has been significantly boosted through this project. This information would need to be collected by the team and provided to the rest of the Cardano community, either through the apps already used to monitor the process or through different means such as synchronous meetings in Town Hall, for example. With this, I believe that the proponent's suggestions on how to audit the project would be increased and we could be more confident about the final impact of this investment. \n",

      "The proposal aims to bring together members of the Cardano community in a more orderly manner, through hubs. This will be done with various goals revolving around outsourcing services. According to the proponent, the aim would be to create self-sufficient organizations that generate revenue and social impact (through products and services for local and international markets). These hubs would have the function of promoting the best positioning of each member of the community within our ecosystem, so that people can be better guided on how to fit into this complex system of projects and solution that is our blockchain. The proponent explains that these organizations would be a kind of catalyst, which would support people to understand and work with use cases in everyday life involving the Cardano blockchain. They would work with innovation, education, professionalization, etc., from what I understand, promoting the training of people and taking into account their particular characteristics, as mentioned by the proponent (their cultures, languages, geographical locations, etc.). I thought it was a very promising and necessary idea, but I identified some problems here. Despite the proponent detailing well what the impact of this project would be 1) individually 2) for nations 3) for the Cardano ecosystem, it is not so clear how the specific objectives of this challenge would be supported. In this challenge, we are specifically looking for ways to improve auditability, that is, ways to monitor funded projects. We know that the number of funded proposals grows exponentially with each fund, which makes it virtually impossible for IOG coordinators to adequately monitor all projects. We know that there are meetings that take place in a standardized way every month, but it is necessary to go further, in my opinion. We need more specific and secure ways to monitor the proposals, and I don't think this proposal is too focused on these activities. The proponent states that auditability would be worked out by creating a whitepaper that “will produce a blueprint for developing an MVP of business operating models and create the applications that will deliver this, leveraging the potential of outsourcing in developing countries.” In other words, the auditability of this project, specifically, would be well worked out, but I don't think this would extend to the other Catalyst funded proposals. In my opinion, the proposal is very good, it really seems to me to be something positively impacting for Cardano, however I think it would fit much better in the “Scale-UP Cardano's Community Hubs” challenge than in this one. Therefore, I will rate the impact neutral, as it strikes me as a high-value and well-structured project, but one that doesn't quite align with the nature of this challenge. \n",

      "The proposal script is excellent, the proposers divide the whole process into phases and we know how many hours (and weeks too, this information is given in Miro) each one will last. We also know which activities would make up each phase. Regarding activity planning, I don't really have any suggestions to make, as I think that the way the script is built and detailed we have a great understanding of what's to come (we know what will be done, how and when). So moving on to the next analysis topic, the budget, I think this part is so well detailed compared to the script. We know how the total amount of 9800 dollars would be divided, the amounts are directly linked with the phases. We know who would be responsible for each activity, how many hours of work would be devoted to it and what the hourly rate of work would be in each individual case. For example, in the excerpt “Phase 4 - Establish Recommendations - $1,800 / · Build R&D and Management Team - 8 hours - $1,600 / · Researchers – 4 hours - $200)”. It is known what phase 4 would be, what total amount would be allocated to it, what smaller activities would be developed, how many hours would be needed and how the larger amount of 1800 dollars would be distributed. In other words, it is also possible to visualize very solidly how the funding will be used, I think this part is perfect as well as the script. Note: I also found the asking amount to be super fair, it is not abusive and makes sense with the complexity and duration of the work actions that will be carried out. Finally, analyzing the team, I think this part is good too, but it could be improved. In general, we have good explanations about team members. We know their names, a very explained curriculum of each, what activities and projects they have been involved in so far. What concerns me here, in fact, are two details: first, that their linkedin profiles or other website where we could verify the said information are not attached. Second, that apparently none of the permanent team members are experts in Cardano, from what I could understand from their professional descriptions, which makes me insecure as to whether they are familiar with our blockchain technologies and will be able to work well with them. Another observation I would like to make is in relation to the counselors (Paul Farmiloe and Dr Julie King). The descriptions about them are very brief, I would like the details to be as in-depth as the other team members.

      "The bidders do not provide us with good auditability of the process, they only claim that they will create “a project plan overseen by a program manager. The plan will have important milestones. They will link to the overall project timeline and program phases as milestones once produced.” Who will be the project manager? What will be the important milestones? How will they be associated with the project phases? I think proponents just name what they are going to do, but don't explain. As a result, this part of the project is quite inadequate. In my view, what would need to be done is: 1. that these milestones be defined with specificity and how they will be measured 2. that the work routines of the professionals involved are also supervised 3. that the Cardano community and the IOG coordinators can always be aware of all updates, partial results and small achievements, that is, it is necessary that a bridge be established between the team and the Cardano community (through telegram, discord, some site like Miro himself ... since they are using this tool to expose the roadmap, they could also use it to perform a periodic update on the development process). Finally, analyzing the auditability of the final results, the proponents define very well what the success scenario would be. In general, it would be the successful creation of “Community Centers (...)” that act as “local catalysts for their own communities, providing a source of income for their local communities to earn income and get involved with the catalyst project, support decentralization across the cultural network to the Catalyst project and ultimately Cardano, and also help to expand the pool of CA and VCA“. Okay, but how can this scenario be meticulously perceived, measured, measured? I think they lacked a way to objectively and verifiably visualize such a scenario. I suggest that the team think of some more objective goals, some quantitative and qualitative data that clearly demonstrate that this has been achieved. This data must be shared with the Cardano community, a demonstrative panel could be created on Miro, with images, texts and graphics that objectively explain such a scenario. It would also be important for us to understand whether the main objective of the challenge, which is to improve the auditability of projects, has been achieved; and if so, how. In other words, unfortunately this is the part that leaves the most to be desired in the proposal, needing to be rethought and better explored. \n",

      "The present challenge aims to benefit both India and the Cardano ecosystem. In this case, this proposal aligns well with that, as, in the words of the proposer himself, it will “create adequate awareness of the benefits of web3 over web2 for people who have no knowledge”. It is about providing a kind of consultancy for developers who are not yet working with technologies relevant to the Cardano ecosystem, providing technical support so that they can launch their MVP at Cardano. I think that this proposal would have a very positive impact and would serve well what the challenge seeks. However, the problem that I identified in this proposal is that it is not explained in a clear and detailed way how this technical support process would take place. There are many things to be done, but they are given to us in a considerably superficial way. We know of some things that would be offered, such as: NFT market offering, custodial and non-custodial wallet, APIs, UI, UX, custom process flows and multi-level access control, etc. However, as much as we know what will be offered, we do not know essential details such as who will do what, that is, which professionals who were mentioned in the part of the team will perform what tasks, we do not know how these consulting sessions would take place. (For example, would individual sessions with each developer be a general meeting with everyone, in which information would be shared equally?). We don't know how long each would be followed, how we could measure the progress of these developers, we don't know exactly what part of the Cardano ecosystem they intend to work on - they might want to become Catalyst proponents, build Dapps, launch CNFTs, in short, there are many possibilities. In summary, I don't think it's very clear what the content of this awareness would be, how it would happen, how we could accompany the benefited developers, what technologies within the web3 universe they would be working with, and so on. In order for the impact of this proposal to become clearer, I would like all these doubts to be clarified. In this way, we could measure much better whether the specific objectives of the challenge would be achieved, that is, whether the natives of India were actually receiving an orientation that would facilitate their entry into the Cardano community; if they would be learning well how to deal, study and work with the technologies that Cardano contains, which could generate opportunities for a fixed and very profitable income in the future. And, if with that, Cardano would also benefit, with new members joining our community, helping the ecosystem to become popular and investing in Ada, creating digital wallets, minting CNFTs and etc. \n",

And these activities could be better detailed, containing: what would be done, in how much time, how and by whom, in addition to what smaller goals. Still, it is possible to draw any kind of visualization of the process as described in the proposal. Now talking about the budget, a total amount of 60 thousand dollars is asked, which is explained in a somewhat confusing way. “Product managers, marketers, content writers, trainers to train and develop the MVP and staff must be $40,000.” Does this mean that the work of all these professionals would cost, together, 40 thousand dollars? How much would it go for each? How many hours of work would each of these people dedicate to this project, so that we can get an idea of ​​the price of their hours of work and conclude if the value is fair or not? “For partnerships and marketing initiatives for these startups to gain visibility. We will spend $5,000 to commercialize the initiative.” If so, what would the marketing campaign look like? What strategies will be adopted, where will it be done (social networks or more traditional media, perhaps?). The proponent also states that the “cost of technical development for basic infrastructure is US$ 15,000”, so, adding these three values, we get the total amount of US$ 60,000. But we also don't know why the technical development of the infrastructure would need to cost 15k, in short, all values ​​should be better explained, clarified. And finally, speaking of the team, we have many professionals involved here, we are given their names, a very brief description of their professional roles and, in most cases, their linkedin profiles, where we can get to know them in a more practical way. and direct. I think that's the best part of the feasibility, although I think it would be better if everyone had attached a linkedin profile, or if they didn't, at least the one of some social network that they have, so that we have a way to prove the information said about everyone. It would also be positive if the details on their CVs were more detailed, if we knew more specifically what they have done so far in their careers and how they relate to our blockchain. So I think the feasibility of this proposal is good, there is a roadmap, the budget breakdown is explained in a relatively basic way, and the team's presentation is not adequate. \n",

      "The auditability of the project is not bad, but at the same time it needs to be deepened to be adequate. Many indicators are mentioned that would serve to monitor how the project development process would be happening and if the desired final results were achieved. However, this data is mostly numerical, I swear that a qualitative analysis would also be necessary. Let's start with the process: fundamental indicators like “number of startups integrated / number of startups launching their MVP / number of trained developers” are cited. But, in addition to knowing the number of people, projects and startups that would be receiving this aid, I would like to know how the team of professionals in this proposal would be organizing themselves in relation to work. That is, are the weekly targets being met? Would they be working the promised hours? Would they be doing all the meetings that were agreed with the developers? It would be necessary, first of all, that we have a very detailed roadmap, by which we could have something to base ourselves on at the moment to monitor if the process was being done as planned. Afterwards, it is necessary for the proponent and some members of his team to update the Cardano community periodically (preferably monthly) on how things are going, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This must be done through direct contact with the community, using any of the various possible platforms (telegram and discord channels, online tools such as google docs, emails, in short, as you prefer). And in relation to the final results, in addition to the aforementioned data collection, it is essential that we have direct contact with the developers who were advised. The most appropriate way for us to do this in my opinion is through synchronous online dating. A meeting could be held in Town Hall to understand how they were helped, if they are now active members of the Cardano community, and if so, what activities they develop, if they still have any doubts about our ecosystem; it would be important that they were fully embraced, in addition to the technical instructions offered in this proposal, but also by other community bodies such as the Catalyst School, if they are interested in submitting proposals, that they participate in the community conversation groups, in short, that they fully enter our community. With that, I think that auditability would be increased, that the numerical suggestions would be added with more humane and careful analysis in relation to the processes and people involved in this project. \n",

      "The idea is interesting although not entirely innovative, because from what I understand here, the goal is to help new people get to know Cardano and Catalyst, and understand where they fit in all of this and how to start working. Basically, these are the activities of the Catalyst School's already active project, which, if I'm not mistaken, was financed two funds ago and already has very good and well-planned activities with the same objectives as this proposal, including some developments such as the individualized follow-up of people and also extensions such as the LATAM Catalyst School, that is, which is geared towards Latin America. I think that this proposal could establish a dialogue with the Catalyst School so that, as was done in the case of Latin America, a school could be created especially focused on South Africa. The proposal has some differentials, in fact, such as the holding of face-to-face meetings with the presence of influencers from the blockchain industry in the locality in question. I think that if this bridge were established, it would be avoided to work the same content twice, on the contrary, the united teams could help each other and innovate (such as these face-to-face meetings). Then, the proposal would be perfectly aligned with the objectives of the challenge, including two challenges: the present, of new members, and also what promotes the benefit of Africa and its inhabitants. In other words, my opinion is that it's a good idea but to avoid unnecessary work creating videos, written documents, graphics and so on about how Catalyst works and how to start working on it, the team should associate with the Catalyst School project; I also believe in the differential of these face-to-face meetings, this is a really innovative part. \n",

      "The script is quite detailed. The activities for each month are defined and explained in detail. In this way, we have a very solid view of the process, with a complete understanding of what is to come and what would be necessary for the development of the project in practice. Regarding the budget, this part is explained clearly, but it could be better detailed; for example because the production of the videos would cost approximately 24 thousand dollars, along with the creation of other content (Workshop Content, Website, Marketing and Social Media Content). But we don't know precise information about each video: the exact size of each one, what kind of video it would be; and even more, as I said about impact, there are already several contents like this on youtube, videos made in the form of animation, by the way, to make your understanding as simple as possible. So I don't see the need to spend such a large amount on producing something that already exists. I believe that instead of saying how much a group of things would cost, it would be better if they explained the value that would be assigned to each one of them. In other words, I think the budget explanation is ok, but it could be even better. And regarding the team's presentation, we are presented in a very shallow way who its participants are, so we can't understand deeply who we are dealing with or if these people are prepared to successfully execute the project. It would be necessary to include a small resume of each, talking about their training, previous jobs and proving all this through some social network, such as linkedin, for example. Apparently as a permanent member that is understood about Cardano we only have Alison Fromm, in addition to the experts who would participate in the face-to-face meeting. It would be better if more people who would work permanently on the project had this knowledge, but one person is the minimum I consider necessary in this regard. Therefore, the feasibility is average, because while some parts (like the script) are great, others should be more detailed, as is the case of the team presentation. \n",

      "This is the part that is best covered in the proposal, because we have useful information for monitoring the proposal both in this session and in impact. We know the activities to be carried out each month (even if we missed how long they would last) and what is expected as a partial result on a monthly basis. We also know the notions of success, audience expectations and the exact reflexes that we expect to see in Catalyst itself, such as the increase in the number of proposals on Catalyst, participants in governance sessions, etc. I think that the team involved in the project could prepare some reports, in a period, and send them to the community, so that we can accurately follow the development of the project. As it is a proposal aimed at South Africa, it would be interesting if, for example, a survey was carried out with the local inhabitants, the people who would participate in the face-to-face meetings, for example, in order to understand the real impact of this project on their lives, if they became active members of the Cardano community, acquired Ada, learned to delegate, if they are participating in any DAO and etc. Another idea I can give is, if a partnership with Catalyst School is made, that this team also provides feedback to the community talking about things that were added to their project and improvements after this association. That said, I think the proposal is highly auditable and deserves top marks in this regard. \n",

      "The idea of ​​the proposal aligns well with the objectives of the challenge. In this challenge, what we are looking for are faster, more practical and efficient ways to audit proposals funded on Catalyst. This need arose because the number of funded proposals grows significantly from one fund to another, making it very difficult for the Cardano community and the IOHK itself to manage well each of these new ideas in execution. This proposal is in line with the solution to this problem as it suggests making auditability in a more standardized way. The idea is, in the words of the proponent, “to provide training in project management using Kanban methods and tools”. Since these methods and tools would come from software and management training offered by the Kanban Zone company. The problem that I identify here is that little is explained about this method and this software. We know, for example, that one of the ways they work is through consultancies, and in this way the support is done more as an advice, not as an order in itself, that is, the official project team would still be free to comply or not certain decisions as the Kanban team's influence would not be the only option. Some things that would be covered in this audit are also described: “Managing project growth / cost benefit / global reach and hosted online / adaptable and simple methods of tracking projects. However, this is still not enough for us to clearly understand how this audit would take place. The proponent also claims that their analysis would be “top-down”, however, he does not explain in detail what, exactly, he means by that. Therefore, I think the idea is good, but it lacks details on how this service provided by Kanban Zone professionals would be in practice. One suggestion I can make is that they cite an example of a consultancy they have already done, so that we could understand exactly how they work, what is the difference between the audit model they propose and those currently used by teams funded by Catalyst. Therefore, I will give 4 stars for the impact of the proposal, because I believe that yes, it is a relevant idea and that it can generate good results, but there was a lack of explanations about how this would happen in practice, if they had been included, I would certainly have more confidence about the positive impact that the proposal would have on our ecosystem. \n",

      "The feasibility of the project is average, because we know the basic information needed to understand the process, budget and team members, however, this information is not detailed enough. Starting with the script. First, it states what would happen in the first month, and then what would be done in the interval between month two and six. The activities are described here in a very superficial way, in addition to the fact that I consider it inappropriate that the proponent has made such a temporal division, from month two to six is ​​four months, this is a very long time, for us to analyze the script carefully it would be more appropriate that this division of tasks be monthly. And regarding the details of the activities, each month should not only contain what would be done, but how it would be done, by whom and how long it would last. Let's take an example: in the first month, one of the activities is “set up a proposal/funded project and audit model for everyone to follow”. As well? What would it be like to configure the proposal and the financed project, would it be in this case to detail the audit model that would be used here? Because if that's the case, in my opinion it would be more interesting if this model was already well detailed and presented in the proposal itself, even before funding. During months two and six, training sessions would be held to talk about the Kanban Zone audit model; where would that happen? Would it be after Town Hall? Who would present these sessions? How would this knowledge be passed on? How many people are expected to attend each session? In my view, from the way activities are described, it is not possible to have a solid understanding of the process. Regarding the budget, I think something similar happens, we know how the total amount requested of 24k USF would be divided, but each of these parts should have been better argued. For example, the team to help the proponents of financed projects and that would receive this consultancy would cost 2 thousand dollars per month, which may or may not be a fair value, depending on how many people would compose this team of consultants, how many hours per week they would work and so on. And finally, speaking of the team, it's about 3 people. About Joey Chesser, all we know is that he is a project management professional. However, we are not presented with a curriculum with examples of previous work, nor do we know how it relates to the Cardano ecosystem, we do not have a social network of yours (such as linkedin) that could prove the said information... We also do not have good information about Sean Sheikholeslam, just his linkedin profile. With Dimitri Ponomateff, we know that he is the CEO of Kanban Zone, and a lot of other information. It would be better if we had the same level of detail for both. They claim that more people from their company or from the Cardano community would be part of the team, but it would be necessary to know who they are and, again, the details I quoted. So I think feasibility is not enough to convey much confidence. \n",

      "The ways of auditing on purpose suggested by the proponent are also basic, we know that, to accompany the process, the following indicators would be used: number of training sessions and how many participants each subject, the audit methods proposed by the Kanban Zone model We will adapt to the proposals and accompaniment of the tools and reports used by the audit team. I agree that these are the best ways to accompany the development process of the proposal, but one thing that will give me life is how everything will be known by the Cardano community. Could it be that they will prepare monthly reports, with all this information, and make them available to us, through discord, or telegram, or online tools such as notion, look, or google docs? How will essa ponte be given? Now that it would be necessary to clarify this question, because it is so important how much to collect these data and make them easily accessible to all Cardano communities. And finally, in relation to the final results, the success indicators are similar to those chosen to monitor the progress of the proposal, the community would be adapted to the consulting method offered and the company's equipment would also be able to adapt to the needs two proponents and their projects. Therefore, since we should go there, it would be necessary to understand the impact of this consultancy on the process of auditing the proposals. I would like to see the difference in results before and after the team enters the action. It would be interesting to have two of our own proponents who foram the perceived improvements, if the work flowed, if the goals that they pursued were more easily achieved with the guidance of the company's team, and so on. I now have a lot of information to be described in a report, being more appropriate than a meeting in video fosse feita. It could also happen after Town Hall, in a specific room, where the team of the Kanban Zone, some project leaders who will receive consultancy and some members of the Cardano community, who will not participate in the project, could discuss together in a qualitative manner the final results obtained. Therefore, I think auditability is ok, but I still have a lot to improve. \n",

      "I found this proposal both interesting (positive) and complex to understand. In general, the proposer aims to create a new platform, it was not very clear to me whether it would be a mobile or computer application, which would be a combination of what we find on job offer/search sites, such as linkedin, and social networks where people could research and keep up to date on blockchain. The advantage for the Cardano ecosystem would be that this platform would be developed on our blockchain, there would be smart contracts and ways to invest in Ada through pools, which would have different functionality between customers/users and companies. The summary of the idea, at least what I understood, is this. Comparing this proposal with the objectives of the present challenge, I think it is very accurate, fitting with mastery into what we seek to achieve in the challenge. Our goal here is to fund Dapp projects that are beneficial to Cardano, that increase the number of transactions on our blockchain, buy and sell Ada and involve, in one way or another, new people in the most diverse technologies of our ecosystem. I think this proposal would do these things, since: 1) the intention here is to create an online space where people looking for a job in the technology area can have access to real opportunities, without falling into a scam, while at the same time those looking to hire professionals can get in touch with their candidates and prove their training and experiences in a non-violating way 2) a place would also be created that would bring together all the social networks and sites that involve the cryptographic world, such as those to consult the price of coins, for example 3) on top of that it would be a good incentive for investments in Ada, through pools. I confess that I understood the users better, they would be paying for access to special resources on the site, about the pool for companies, I found the explanation more difficult. In that sense, the proposal is very good and makes a lot of sense for the objectives of the challenge, but I have a few things to note. Even with effort I found the description of the proposal difficult to understand, I am CA has 4 funds and I am already familiar with several terms in the cryptographic universe and the technologies that surround it, but I have no training in anything that involves technology itself. I believe that CAs, vCAs and voters with a profile similar to mine may have a little difficulty understanding this proposal fully, so I would suggest that the proposer explain the technical parts in a more accessible way for everyone. The complexity of the project worries me a little, as the proponent would be able to gather so many things and utilities in a single application. Other than that, I think the proposal is quite relevant and has a certain impact. \n",

      "The proponent details the tasks to be carried out to carry out the project, but I would like to comment on two things. The first is that, as with the explanation of the idea in impact, several tasks are very technical and complex, so it would be interesting for the author of the proposal to include a small, simple and accessible explanation of what they mean and what they are for in the process as one all. This would serve as a leveling-off for all readers, it's true that this challenge has several very technical proposals but I think it even meets Cardano's goals to make everything as democratic as possible, so the better the number of people who understand and can evaluate this and the other proposals better. Would it also be important for him to align this list of tasks with a temporal notion, that is, how long would each of them take to be done? Most proposals divide the entire development into phases, and the more broken down the better. For example, phase one could encompass the months of May, June and July. The two, August and September (just an example). These months could be divided into weeks, so that the understanding of the process was complete. Regarding the budget, I found the value very fair for the complexity of the project and what needs to be done to make it happen. The author asks for 10k, and explains that part would go to development and part to marketing. It would be interesting for him to better explain the marketing strategies and who would be responsible for it, because I noticed that he does not have any professional in this area working on the project, which I think is a problem, this proposal is based on creating a targeted platform to the public, so you need to make sure that these people know about the project and are attracted to using the platform. And finally about the team's explanation, from what I understand there are 2 people involved: the proponent, who has experience with blockchain and e-commerce, and another developer who also has experience working with Cardano. The detailing here could be more in-depth too: a more complete explanation could be made about those involved, providing some kind of proof of what is said (for example, the other developer has a connection with a University, could we see it on that institution's website? the profile of this professional?). Your linkedin profiles would also be most welcome. Other than that, I'm worried about who will do the design and marketing parts, which are just as important as the computing parts, in my opinion. Overall I think the feasibility conveys confidence, although it can be improved. \n",

      "The author gives us some specific objectives to be achieved in this project so that it can be considered successful. I believe that the most appropriate thing would be for some members of the Cardano community who understand the technologies being developed here to establish a direct contact and period with the proponent, in order to verify both the process and the results and bring this feedback in a simplified way to the rest of the project. community. This can be done based on the information provided by the author, both in relation to the process and the results. About the process: it can be perceived based on the data provided in the previous topic of feasibility, the tasks to be performed. This would be done more safely if we were told how long each task would have to be done, as I mentioned earlier. And the results could be measured based on the information provided here in the auditability, it would be interesting for all of this to be gathered and taken to the rest of the community on a regular basis. From what I could understand this project would not be fully covered in fund 8, but I think it's better when a proponent asks for a portion of the money in a fund and delivers results before wanting more funding. In this sense, I believe in the auditability of the proposal, as long as there is specialized monitoring by the Cardano community. \n",

      "I loved this proposal, I thought it was very accurate in the sense that: here we have a very clear objective of what to do, and it will be very beneficial for both Indians and Cardano. But let's explain everything in detail. The idea is to train 200 young people to work with web applications3, that is, applications that are somehow linked to the blockchain. The proponent informs that many times even people who work with technology do not follow this career for lack of people who teach content in an accessible way and also because they do not know the opportunities that this type of application can offer. I thought it was excellent how the proponent attaches here a link that supports his speech, as this argument is always necessary for us to understand the validity of past information. With these issues in mind, the core of this proposal can be summed up very well in the following excerpt: “It is not only about enabling students to become good quality developers, but we also want them to help them have a successful career. For that, we want to empower them as entrepreneurs to launch their own startup or provide a good career on the web3, connecting them with other successful entrepreneurs”. This dialogues directly with the two facets explored in this challenge: the benefit of Cardano first, after all, IOHK is investing financially and it is essential that our blockchain is at least popularized in these proposals. This would certainly happen here as new students on web3 mean in the future new professionals working with Cardano's technologies, that is, the expansion of our ecosystem. Future developers of smart contracts will probably be born from this project, or members for startup teams that can become DAOs, in short, it's clear to me how Cardano would benefit from this initiative. In the same way, the target audience, that is, Indians, would also benefit greatly, since countless opportunities would be available from the moment they learn to deal with web technologies3. This is, in practice, employment and income opportunities that are certainly very promising, as I believe that in the future the need for this workforce will only increase. It is also positive as the proponent claims to have a lot of networking, this increases the chances that universities, public and private organizations will get involved in the project, further expanding the possibilities for the 200 Indians that will be contemplated. It's definitely a top note. \n",

      "The feasibility of the proposal is, in my view, average, as we generally have the basic information needed to understand the project planning, how the requested money will be spent and also who are the professionals involved. However, each of these parts could be more detailed. Starting with analyzing the script, the proponent divides the total time into 3 blocks: the first month, after 1 month and the final results. He even provided an interesting level of detail regarding the first two months, explaining well what would be done and in what way. But in relation to the third month onwards, how would the activities be organized? I would like all the project months to be as well explained as the first 2. What time interval between the first 2 and the final results? Anyway, I think this part of the proposal deserves an improvement. Now let's talk about the budget, the amount requested is 30 thousand dollars, I found a fair value for the magnitude of the proposal (200 students would be educated of, which would generate an average 150 dollars per person helped, which is very reasonable) . The whole is divided into a few parts, which are: “course material will cost about US$5,000” + “travel and infrastructure cost will be US$5,000” + “$20,000 in training”. Do you agree that each of these parts could be better explained? Why the course material will cost 5 thousand dollars, what is this trip that is mentioned? The $20,000 of training would be geared toward students, but how would that be done? Will scholarships be given? I think that part could have been better explored as well. finally, speaking of the team, I think we have a lot of information about some team members (Nicky Jacob for example) while others have very little information about themselves (George, Thanuj Sinha and Nabarun Chakrabortty). Ideally, the same level of detail would be presented to each of those involved, that is, we would know their names, what their professional attributions are, a brief summarize of what they have done so far (whether these activities are relevant or not to the Cardano ecosystem) and the linkedin profiles (that part is ok!). In other words, we need to know a lot of information about everyone so that total confidence in the team is transmitted. However, all the parts of viability, as I've already said, provide us with what we need to know deep down. A little more detail would level up this part of the proposal, but it's still good. \n",

      "On the auditability of the process: in fact, I think that half of what we need to know is explored here. We would know how many students would actually be involved in the project and also how they would be putting into practice the knowledge acquired in this course (let's call it that to make it easier), as this information would be made available on GitLab (each student would open an account). However, I think it would also be necessary for the proponent to explain how the team's work could be tracked each month. Do you agree that in basically all proposals we have tasks and goals? That is, tasks would be what we would do and goals for what. And in the auditability of the process here, we know what the goals would be, but it's clear how the tasks could be tracked. I suggest that the proponent make this correction by providing ways for us to keep track of these two fundamental and directly related parts. Now in terms of success, I thought the proponent suggests very interesting ways for us to verify that the objectives have been achieved. I think this is because he does not suggest that only quantitative data be analyzed (we know that the goal is 200 students and that all receive course certificates); he also suggests other, more qualitative ways in which we could audit success, such as: “10% of admission is placed in a startup even before course completion” and “Able to attract local sponsorship for next cycle execution”. In my view, the analysis he proposes is perfect because from this information the impact of this project would already be indicated both on the Cardano ecosystem and on the local population of India. The only thing I would suggest is that he make it clearer how all this could be analyzed by the Cardano community. Ideally, the proposer and his team would actually do a bunch of research and summarize it all in either a big final report or a video presentation, which could be part of a Town Hall, for example. Summarizing what I think: in the auditability of progress, it is necessary that we also have ways to verify the tasks; and in the auditability of the results, it is necessary to clarify how the Cardano community will be able to verify all the data collected. \n",

      "In this challenge, we seek to finance others that do not fit well with others, as is the case here. I loved this idea. It is about creating a laundry service called “Eco Laundry Center (EcoLC)”, where people take their dirty clothes and pay for the washing service with waste that they would discard in the trash, of course, properly separated. This project also relates to our blockchain because it would make NFTs available that people would buy in order to be sure about how this initiative is helping to reduce the emission of cardan in the atmosphere, as the excerpt says: “EcoLC really helps to reduce the carbon emissions into the atmosphere, and this will be certified with carbon credits. NFT owners will receive an annual airdrop with carbon credit certification.” The logic is that the garbage that would be disposed of inappropriately receives a useful purpose, as it would be used as the currency for people to wash their clothes in this innovation center, I think I can call it that, because it is something that already exists, seen in a different way. brand new and that will surely benefit the environment and Cardano. The benefit would not only be environmental, as already mentioned due to the amount of waste that would not be discarded, if the application were a success. This would also have a social impact indirectly, as holders of these NFTs might see them appreciate in value over time, so this would be a form of investment. Depending on the initial price of NFTs, people in developing countries could buy them and then sell them, which would help improve local income. I think the proposal is very good because in addition to these clearly environmental and indirectly social benefits, it could help popularize our blockchain. Let's say that a certain portion of the population that has never even heard of blockchain, let alone Cardano, became aware of this “free” laundry service, for sure if this project succeeds it can attract new members to the Cardano ecosystem. And also for the fact that the proponent says that payments could also be made in cryptocurrencies (it would be better if they were exclusively in Ada). This would also open up a new possibility of use for our currency. Anyway, the only criticism I have would be that it is not explained in this part of the impact how Dapp would relate to this physical space, would there be appointments to go there? Would there be information there like “how much organic waste do you need to bring to wash X amount of clothes”? Anyway, I really liked the idea, and for the reasons explained, I think it has the potential to have maximum impact. \n",

      "The viability of the project is good, despite having some points to improve. Let's start with the script. The general idea of ​​what will be done is described very well in this paragraph: “The solution offered is a system that combines four different technologies already known: small Biogas installation with small co-generator, wetlands built for recycling water, waste compactor, NFTs. all four of these technologies are well known, just combine them. I have dealt with each of these technologies in the past.” Although the proponent describes some activities that are necessary to make this idea a reality, this description is not exactly a roadmap, because we have no notion of time. In my view, this project is complex, so how long would it take in total to develop? It is necessary for the proponent to place us better in relation to temporality. He doesn't need to start the script from scratch, he could take the information we already have and relate it to some time intervals. For example, the first task would be “Create an NFT crowdfunding campaign and promote it accordingly”. How long would this last? 1 month, 2 months? Who would work on it? Now moving on to the second point of feasibility analysis: the budget. Usually people ask for a total amount and divide it into small parts, but without explaining well what each of them would be. This does not happen here, the proponent is concerned with arguing well what the uses of each requested part of the budget would be, making us understand the need for the 10 thousand dollars requested. From what I understand, the actual price of each such installation would be in the range of 100 thousand dollars, it is not very clear to me how the rest of the money would be used. If the bidder had made available the file he cites in “We can provide a detailed file with each component, but it's a huge file”, I think a higher budget could even be requested. Now, speaking of the team, we have the names and information of each of those involved. Regarding Marcello Ambrosio, his presentation is ideal, he provides many details about his academic and professional background and even provides an article that talks about him, but in relation to his colleagues, the level of detail is not the same. The information passed on about the other team members is quite basic, I would like them to also make their resume available through linkedin, preferably, so that we could verify the information that is said. In general, auditability is good, yes; but the description of activities should have been related to time intervals and the detailing of team members should have been similar for all involved. \n",

      "The auditability suggested by the bidder is good, but there is room for improvement. Let's start by analyzing the development process: first, it would be nice to understand how far this proposal intends to go. We know that the construction of the floor plan (floor plan, I imagine, as from what I understand the proponent is a landscape architect) would be a strong indication that we are heading in the right direction. But until then, it will be necessary to carry out the crowdfunding campaigns, then launch the first NFTs that would also help raise funds for the project... In short, there are several partial results to be achieved, so how could we from the Cardano community follow these small advances? I think the bidder successfully outlines what needs to be audited, but not how it would be audited. I suggest that he and his team make a monthly survey of the activities carried out in that period of time, of the achievements, difficulties, mistakes and successes, in short, of everything that happened in the development process of this project that month. And then, these variables need to be made available so that the whole community can consult them, either through online tools preferred by team members, such as google docs, or a written report is made and posted on our website. Telegram group “Project Catalyst”. Regarding the final results, I think that this part is still a bit abstract, since we are so early in the project, but certainly the proponent already traces well that “true success will come when we have the first initiative started on our own, for someone who heard about EcoLC and decided to create an NFT crowdfund initiative on the platform.” However, as I think this is still something that will be far ahead, I would like him to have traced other KPIs that could make us understand that the project has finally achieved what was planned for with the funding of 10 thousand dollars. And once again, when formed and organized, this information should be easily accessible to all members of the Cardano community. In summary, I like the auditability, but I think there was still a certain notion of “what is really captureable at the moment and how can we perceive it, in relation to achievements” still lacking. \n",

      "The purpose of this application would be to bring music lovers together with the cryptographic universe. The proponent claims that the music industry is one of the strongest today, both in terms of profit and the people involved in it. The idea would then be to bring this target audience that is not necessarily associated with blockchain to our community. This would be done in a number of ways, for example: 1) users would know who owns certain musical instruments in their neighborhood, so they could rent them 2) finding music teachers, teams to form a band, venues for rehearsals and etc. 3) providing scholarships in the field of music 4) among others. The proponent explains that he intends to introduce the technologies of the cryptographic world little by little, through tutorials and also discounts on transactions that are made by the Cardano blockchain. So, from what I understand, the financial transactions (for example, the payment of the rent of some instrument) would be done through smart contracts as the application developed. What worries me is that these transactions would not be done initially on the blockchain, people would have the option to carry out them in a conventional way, and using their fiat currencies. How far can we count on the curiosity of the target audience to choose the cryptographic alternative? The proponent explains in great detail what the phases of development of the project would be (I will comment further on this in the topic below), so we were able to visualize very well which parts would make up the whole, how they would be created and what would be necessary for each of them to be completed successfully. We also know important information such as Dapp's target audience and competition. In the revenue model part, he explains how all the profit that would be generated from the various activities would be managed and what fees would be charged, giving us even more knowledge about Dapp as a whole and all the layers that make it up. Although I find the idea very interesting and I think it could become a very popular Dapp, even with so many explanations it is not clear to what extent Cardano ecosystem technologies will be used. Really, the only part that mentions this directly is in relation to payments, which can be done through smart contracts, but even so, I think we could include other Cardano features, such as Atala Prism DIDs, so that the impact of this project would be more significant for our blockchain. In the section “we are very open to linking and connecting our platform with other projects in the community to help each other develop”, it gives us even more room to think that in reality this project is not so intertwined with Cardano's solutions; And yes, it has the potential to be. So, unfortunately, I wasn't very sure about the impact that this Dapp will have on our blockchain and I'm not so sure that the goals aimed here are perfectly aligned with those defined for this challenge. \n",

      "The script is very good in the first parts, because we are told which activities will be done and in which weeks. The temporal division is very exact, I usually say that at least we would need to know what would happen each month, but in the case of a division into weeks, our understanding is even better. So I really think this part was going really well until the “Next Months: More In-Depth Business Analysis and Adding Features Based on User Feedback” snippet. I think it would be important for the bidder to have thought through the plan from the time of funding to its final delivery, rather than detailing the first few weeks and leaving the next few months so vaguely explained. How many months would it be? How would this analysis of the business be done, and in what way would it be more in-depth than previous actions? How would user feedback be captured, and how would changes be implemented from there? Therefore, my suggestion is that the proponent could keep the level of detail more homogeneous throughout the entire length of the script. 41 thousand dollars are requested for the development of this project; Regarding the financial explanations, I think everything is very well detailed. For example, we know who would do what, for how long and what the hourly rate for that professional would be, as can be seen in the excerpt “1 Technical Project Manager: $45/hour ($1,500/week x 4 weeks = $6,000)”. This part in my opinion is quite adequate and does not need improvement. Finally, talking about the team of professionals involved in the project, this part is good, but a very important detail concerns me. We know the names, the professional roles, previous experiences and the roles that each professional would play in the project. However, only the bidder attaches his linkedin profile, so we have ways of verifying what is being said to the other team members. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to me that any of the professionals are experts in the Cardano blockchain, I don't feel that they are familiar with the technologies of our ecosystem, even in the case of a developer: Ranger Guan has “More than 9 years of experience in software development. Specialist in front-end and multiple languages ​​(PHP, javascript, TypeScript, Python…)”. We see here that he is unfamiliar with Plutus, for example. Anyway, I think that if someone is really involved with the solutions that Cardano has, it is a little difficult to trust that, for example, smart contracts will be developed properly, that other Cardano technologies can be attached as the project evolves, etc. . So my take on feasibility is that it's good, but some things could be improved; such as the full detailing of the script and further clarification on who would guide the guiding questions regarding Cardano. \n",

      "The proponent states that updates on the project's advances will be made through various platforms such as twitter, github, telegram and instagram. He says that successes and struggles will be shared, that is, with this I conclude that he will update the community both on the tasks and on the goals that will be achieved. However, I found that in terms of tasks, it's a little vague about how these updates will be done. We know exactly what would happen in the first few weeks, and during the impact the proponent also provided us with a more general explanation of what would be done in each phase, so that we get a sense of the deliverable results. My suggestion is that the entire script is better detailed, as I have already mentioned in the topic above, so that we have a better basis for monitoring, that is, we know better what to base ourselves on when exercising this auditability. Regarding partial achievements, this part is clearer, as the proponent exemplifies some of them (“increase in registered users, funds raised for scholarships, paid scholarships and student tracking, or influencer ads will be published on these social media” ). Another issue that could be better clarified is the regularity with which these updates would be posted. Monthly, weekly, quarterly? I think that the more often the better, but it would be necessary for the proponent to clarify this question for us. Finally, talking about the success scenario, the proponent describes what is expected to be achieved in 3, 6 and 12 months. We have a lot of information about what the absolute success of the project would then be like. However, what is lacking here are practical ways of verifying such information. How to make them measurable, easily verifiable? It would be important for the proponent to clarify such issues. I also think that the auditability leaves something to be desired since we don't know how to measure the consequences directly for Cardano. How has this Dapp contributed to the expansion of our ecosystem? Will people who choose to transact in ada become active members? The proponent mentions that he has another proposal, which would be an NFT marketplace, I would like this to be explained more, in which case I would better understand how the project would relate to Cardano and have more confidence about the impact, for example. Anyway, the auditability is good, but it could have been clarified 1) how often updates on the process would be made 2) how the consequences for Cardano would be measured 3) how the final results would be exposed to our community. \n",

      "I disagree that this proposal fits the objectives of the challenge. Because here our goal is to finance projects that are at the same time good for East Asia, helping this region of the continent to develop economically, socially and if possible environmentally (or at least one of these areas) so that our blockchain can also increase in level of popularity and investments. This proposal is about creating a token that would have multiple use cases; would be these “staking - users will earn rewards by betting + purchase promotions - business partners can use token to buy more social media promotion + buy goods - eventually can be used for payment + purchase data - use as payment for purchase /data sale”. But how will this specifically help East Asia and its inhabitants? Really, I can't see what the direct benefits would be for this location and its natives, so I think the proponent should make it clearer why she chose to launch this proposal in this challenge. It doesn't seem in line with the metrics here, maybe this project would fit better with the Dapps challenge, for example. Therefore, as much as the application is useful for Cardano, it would be meeting only one of the facets necessary for the challenge to be adequately addressed, with that, I will unfortunately give a low note for the impact. \n",

With that, I think there is a lot of confidence in the ability of this team to execute the project safely. Some members have more detailed explanations than others, but in general, we have enough information on everyone, so I have nothing to criticize on this part of the feasibility. In my opinion, she is perfect. Now talking about the script, I think the proponent explains very well what would need to be done, detailing a lot about the activities that would take place. We have a solid understanding of what the process would be like, the problem I identified was that a well-established temporal relationship is not traced, that is, even though we know exactly what would be done, it is not so clear when such things would be done. And really, I believe that for the script to be perfect, these two parts would need to complete each other. Finally, speaking of the budget, the total amount is divided into 3 parts, the last one (Payment Gateway Balance for fiat-crypto is $15,000) could be better specified. Why would that cost $15,000? The first two could also contain more details, but it was really in this last installment that I was a little confused, without understanding exactly what would generate the expense, it is not so clear to us readers what that would be. Therefore, I think the feasibility is average, presenting some correct points (the team presentation stands out) but also others to be improved (the notion of time in the script and the explanation of this final value). \n",

      "I don't think auditability of progress is adequate because the proponent says it will base itself on numbers to understand if the partial results to be achieved are actually being achieved. I think we should also have some way of auditing the tasks of professionals, tasks that would generate the goals to be analyzed. Both parties are required to be evaluated. It is necessary for the team to prepare monthly reports, for example, on how their work routines have been, and make them available to the entire Cardano community. Regarding the final results, in my honest opinion, the goal is very ambitious: “The success of the project will be to see this in every store, in every country in the world and hand it over to the DAO so that it can run on its own. . We will continue to achieve this.” How can we more accurately and objectively measure whether the project is actually being adopted by stores? It would be interesting for the team to do some research gathering information about which stores are using the technology and in what way. It is also essential that the team analyze the direct impacts of all this for our blockchain and also for East Asia, after all, these are the two pillars of the challenge. How has this proposal contributed to the greater adoption of Cardano in this geographic region? And how has this impacted the lives of the locals? All this information must be measured precisely and brought to the Cardano community in a simple and appropriate way. Unfortunately, I don't think the auditability is enough for us to accurately monitor the project. \n",

      "Proponents do not make it clear what would actually be developed here. They claim to have a project, called Alexandra (TAP), in which they are already working towards the dissemination of Cardano technologies to a wider audience, through the revolution of “blockchain publishing, decentralized education, content distribution, file collections and other web3 solutions for the fields of art, information, literature, science and technology”. This explanation is just as abstract. What publications are these? What content do they distribute? What examples of decentralized information and education can they tell us about? In a direct and objective way, it would be necessary for the proponents to have cited examples of the activities they develop, explaining the projects in progress, who the target audience is, in which places (countries, cities) they operate, specific examples that can prove how they has contributed to the dissemination of Cardano to a wider audience. They start talking about developing a library in Web3, I think the idea is fantastic, but unfortunately they don't develop tesa, that is, they don't explain how this library would be built, where, how the target audience would be reached, examples of contents that would be present there, in short, we don't know the characteristics of this new project; nor how Web3 would be associated with it. It is not clear what they have done so far, what they intend to do with this funding, or how they involve Cardano with everything. Therefore, I cannot reliably visualize how this proposal would impact our blockchain. In this challenge, we seek to finance projects that do not fit well with the other challenges, which may even be the case, but it needs to be very clear how what will be developed will help Cardano, in the sense of integrating new active members, increasing the number of transactions and Ada and CNFTs minted on our blockchain, increase investment in our Dapps, in short, help spread the mass adoption of Cardano. Therefore, unfortunately, I think that, due to the lack of explanations and clarifications, it is not possible to adequately understand what would be done here or how this would generate positive consequences for our ecosystem. \n",

      "The feasibility of the project is better than the impact. We have a very detailed roadmap, in which we can understand well what are the tasks that would need to be developed in the process of creating this library. I thought it was very positive how the proponents placed these activities based on weeks, because that way we have a very specific understanding of the whole process. Unfortunately, understanding the tasks doesn't make us understand the final product properly, we know what would be done and how, but not what the project would look like when it was delivered and how it would work from there. So I stand by my position on impact, it's very difficult to know how all this will have direct consequences for Cardano. Turning now to funding, I think this part was also good, the total amount is divided into some parts and these are well explained, for example: “$2500 to develop CNFT records of important Marcos Cardano. 100 hours @ $25 per hour”, we know what the hourly value of the professionals involved in this part would be; “$3500 to develop infrastructure to catalog web library 3 in human readable format - programming, web development, video, content distribution”, we know by which smaller parts the infrastructure development would be guided. Therefore, I think that, financially, the project is completely understandable, and I agree that the asking price was fair. Regarding the team, I think this part could have been a little better, because we do know some basic information about those involved, but more detail would add value to this part of the proposal. For example, “Thiscrazylife - Programmatic and Digital CNFT Artist. Creator of @TheRefreshCNFT, powered by Cardano, going to number 1 and burning questions.” As I understand it, they appended their nicknames, not their names. I would like to know the real names of each team member, we know in a basic way how they work, that is, in which professional area (if they are developers, artists, etc.), but we do not have a good explanation of their CVs, nor do we know their linkedin profiles (or even their portfolios in the case of artists); in other words, we have no means by which to confirm the information that is reported.

      "I think proponents are a good principle of process auditability in “the project will document the number of posts, likes, comments, video views, to track engagement and make all data available to the public with full transparency”. However, some doubts arise: where will this documentation be made? How will the Cardano community have access to such information, in a transparent manner, as mentioned by the proponents? I think they are already well on their way, all that was needed was to develop the idea, provide us with more details on how this process would be in practice. It would also be important, in my view, for them to report the work process, how their routines would be, if there were challenges, if all team members fulfilled their roles each week and so on. This can be easily monitored since we already have a very detailed roadmap, so we have a base of content to go by. Speaking now about the final results, unfortunately in this part the explanations are much more abstract, we know that the goal here is to create a Web3 library, “expanding the scale and scope of Project Alexandra”. However, it would be necessary for us to be more precise with the information to be measured, with more palpable consequences about success. How can we measure the expansion of the Alexandra project? What indicators will indicate that really new active members have been added to the Cardano community? Which Cardano technologies are being most adopted (digital wallets, Ada, native tokens, etc)? It would be necessary for the proponents to carry out a more specific study on the impacts of this proposal, both for their own project and for the Cardano ecosystem; and just like the partial results, the final results must be accessible quickly, safely and practically for all members of our ecosystem. In conclusion, my opinion is that this topic started well, but it got lost a bit, essential information such as where the partial results would be documented is absent, and the explanations about the success are very abstract, which in my view makes this proposal difficult to audit. \n",

      "The proposal theoretically fits the challenge, but I encountered some problems here. Starting with the game description: it is confusing, we know that it will be a card game, that players will own NFT and at some point will create them in the metaverse, that there would be battles and it would be a game that you can profit from. This is interesting because it would combine two very common interests of the gamer community, the love for games and the possibility of generating income doing what they like. We also know that it would be a poster game, where people would collect cards from creatures, monsters, pets, and so on. But it's a little confusing how these battles would play out, would it be one player against another, or would they be through teams? How long on average would each battle last? The explanation of what we would do in the game, how its phases would be, how the player would evolve, how they would profit and etc is confusing, I couldn't understand exactly how a match would be, for example. The proponent explains that the game is free to start playing but at a certain point you would have to pay to continue evolving, it would be interesting to understand at what point this would happen and where the money paid by players would go. It is also unclear how this game would contribute to the Cardano ecosystem. Would all the NFTs here be minted on our blockchain? To receive the profits generated during the game, would people link their digital wallets? Would the winnings be entirely in game tokens or would there be any payout in Ada? How would players learn about Cardano's technologies, their differentials and advantages? In general, my opinion is that the game can be a good idea, it can fit with what we are looking for in the challenge (funding game projects that are beneficial to the Cardano ecosystem, either through the popularization of our currency, transactions in the our blockchain, NFTs coining in Cardano, player involvement in the ecosystem and etc); however, there was a lack of clarity to understand 1) how the day-to-day of the game would be, we do have a lot of information that says about the characteristics of the game, for example that it is a play-to-win modality, the players would be the owners of all the NFTs and etc, but it is not clear what a game would be like, the evolution of each one in the game and etc 2) to what extent this game would be built based on our blockchain and would benefit Cardano.

      "This part of the proposal was also confusing, unfortunately. The proponent explains twice about the script and the use of the budget, I didn't understand if the first explanation would be a more general overview and the second a more detailed one, but anyway, let's evaluate it in parts. In the first explanation of the roadmap, we are told what tasks would happen in the 2022 quarters (the second, third and fourth). It worries me that from what I understand this would not be the total development time of the game as it requires a very high funding of 100k dollars. But going back to the analysis of the script: it is positive how the proponent divides the total time in part and inserts tasks to be performed in them, but the explanation of each one of them is still superficial. He could better detail each of these activities so that we could have a deeper understanding of the whole process. It would also be important to clarify how long each of these tasks would take. Some quarters are better detailed than others, I don't know if because they would be more “hectic” in the development of the project or if the proponent really provides more information about some than about others. Example of what an ideal roadmap would look like for me, in this proposal: in the first quarter, the proposer informs us of 3 tasks. I would like each of them to have a small text detailing how it would be made and how long it would last. For example, in three months we have 3 tasks, would each one last 1 month? When would the minting of the posters begin and when would it be completed? In Q4, the activities are better detailed, with only the notion of time being absent. As far as the budget is concerned, it is explained very superficially, for example 72k would go to design. Would all that work and money go to just one person? With such a high budget, a more detailed explanation would be needed. Why is 72k dollars needed? The design creation process would be divided into which steps? How could we better understand the use of this money in parts? As with the design, the other parts should also have been better explained. Right after the first explanation of the roadmap and budget, the bidder includes a second explanation that talks more about each quarter, the activities performed and the parts of the funding used per hour. This somewhat improves the understanding of the script and budget, but it is still confusing because these things are divided into two parts, I would like everything to be put together in a single explanation, clearer, longer and more detailed. And finally, about the team, only 2 professionals are presented. The game would need a complete team to be made properly, with professionals from various areas such as design, programming, marketing, narration, etc. I would like to know who the other team members would be, or if, in this case, the two permanent professionals would still hire the other people involved (this is not clear). A detailed explanation of the two professionals present is also not attached, I would like to know more about their CVs and how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem. In general, the script and budget explanation is a bit confusing, split, and lacked more detail in some parts, while the staff's explanation leaves a lot to be desired. \n",

      "The auditability of the proposal is average. At certain points, I also found it confusing. The proponent included Covid awareness in the middle of the success metrics, I didn't understand the direct relationship of this to the game. It sets out what medium- and long-term success would look like, emphasizing that the clearest success scenario would be when players were able to enjoy themselves and generate income from the game. I agree that this would be the ultimate goal, it also informs other things we could look into to see if the game is developing as expected, and the information provided is mostly qualitative. I would like two more things to be done here: for the proponent to include some numerical data, by which we could verify the success of his project more objectively, using statistics in our favor; that there were also clearer ways to measure the consequences of the game for the Cardano ecosystem, such as whether there was an increase in digital wallets, purchase of Ada, investments in pools, NFTs minted on the blockchain, active participation of players in the ecosystem, either by through Catalyst or other ways. In general I do not agree that the bidder provides sufficient and satisfactory information for us to accurately measure whether the game has had considerable positive consequences for Cardano. I suggest that he clarify these issues, taking into account my suggestions and those of other CAs. I also think it would be necessary for the community to track the progress of the game's development, not just the results. This can be done either if the proponent, in communion with his team, gives us feedback on the partial results of the game's development, through reports, for example; or if some members of the Cardano community, preferably who understand and are interested in the gaming universe, would follow the stages and their tasks and bring updates for the rest of us. In general, the auditability exists and it is not bad, but it can still improve a lot. \n",

      "I found interesting features of Dapp mentioned here, such as some mailings (if the recipient sends the buyer does not receive), some recipient in game 3 mediators for example to check all the documentation and financial solver. However, those people who would do the mediation would be pagans, or who would generate more for the merchants; and the problem commented by the proponents is that precisely these merchants do not have the time or resources to spend converting Ada into their local currencies (such as reais, pesos, etc.). The definition of the problem can be seen directly in the following excerpt “Merchants do not have the time and resources to spend on receiving payment in cryptocurrency (b2) and on converting to a stable currency such as the dollar or even a fiat currency (...) ”. I think the idea of ​​Dapp itself is good, but I disagree with this proposition, because to convert Ada into any other currency, be it a cryptocurrency or fiat currency, it is not necessary to pay any fees, this process can be done for free on cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance, for example, and in a matter of seconds. So I don't think it's true that someone doesn't have the time to do something so fast, and that they don't have the resources, since it's a free conversion. The problem that I think is real is an approximate desin of how to create a digital wallet for payments in Ada, how to transfer from the wallet to the correct one, how to convert the correct currencies and how to send them to your traditional bank accounts. Receiving payments in Ada is also an issue due to its volatility, but that is not the crux of the matter as the bidder would just facilitate Ada to be converted into fiat currency, as I understand it, automatically. I think that Dapp is not well suited to the objectives of the challenge because it does not represent an idea that is enough to explain, this conversion, as I have already done, can be done quickly and free of charge on brokers that already exist, that traders are properly instructed to do so. Therefore, the project would contribute, popularization and wide adoption of our blockchain, not increase the technology expansion of the merchant community; precisely because it is something that already exists (even if it is not the same, but there are already simple and practical ways to do this). \n",

The presence of these topics breaks down the information about each of the phases, my only suggestion would be that the notion of time was divided into a smaller scale, that is, we knew how long activities 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and so on would take to develop . If we knew this, surely our understanding of the process would increase and become more solid. However, the script is already good, this is just a suggestion to make it even more understandable in terms of time. Now, talking about the budget, the total amount is broken down into a few parts and these are generally well explained (e.g. we know exactly how many hours per week the developer and DevOps specialist would work; we know the total work time per month and how much he would get paid per hour, so the $28,800 allotted to his salary is well justified); however other parts of the funding should be explained in more detail as well, eg “1 scalable application server (6 months) = $6,400”. What server is this and why does it cost over a thousand dollars a month? What technical role would this service play for the whole? It would be interesting if this part was explained better so that all readers of the proposal, including those who are not very tech-savvy, could equally understand how the budget would be used for these more technical parts. Finally, speaking of the team, it is actually a duo; We know a good deal about each one, which includes their training areas, where they work professionally, examples of some experiences they already have and how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem. The only part that was left pending was the provision of their linkedin profiles, so that the information they were told could be substantiated.

      "Unfortunately, the auditability provided is quite superficial. As a way of monitoring the development processes, the proponents inform the time that each phase would take to complete, however these are very extensive intervals of 3, 2 and 1 month. It would be necessary for the proponents to prepare reports at the end of each month, explaining how the development of this project was, both in terms of tasks and partially achieved goals. The tasks in this case would be a summary of the work routine of all the professionals involved, if they did what was planned at the right time and in the right way (the script is well broken down in relation to the phases, so I think we have a good material to serve as a basis for this auditability); it would also be logically necessary for them to establish KPIs that indicate what should be achieved gradually. These reports should be made available to the Cardano community in a simple and practical way, so that we all stay abreast of the project's progressive updates. Regarding the final results, I found the chosen metrics to be completely numerical, numbers are indeed important, but I would like a qualitative analysis about the results of the project, its consequences for both merchants and the Cardano ecosystem. How has this Dapp contributed to our blockchain being more widely adopted? Despite the purpose being to convert Ada, did this Dapp allow more payments to be made with our cryptocurrency? Have merchants somehow become interested in Cardano's technologies and started to try to understand more about other of our technologies? And what was the impact to the local economies where this Dapp was implemented? I think that more comprehensive and deeper research would be needed on the measurable impacts/end results of Dapp, and that it also be shared in a simple way with all members of the Cardano ecosystem.

I found the idea very interesting because it aggregates several means of transport and proves that deliveries of different natures are made; I think this is something different than what we already see in pre-existing transport apps. Another feature of the project that I found interesting was the fact that this service was adapted to the drivers' routes, so it would not be the workers who would be shaped by the work, but the opposite. As the drivers will deliver in a perimeter they would already travel, the proponents explain that the project would also be sustainable, which I agree; since it would not be necessary for more people to travel a single route. What I think was still a little vague was: how does all this relate to the Cardano ecosystem? On the subsystems side, the proponents claim that native tokens would be generated (minted on the Cardano blockchain, probably); that somehow Atala Prism DIDs would also be used, but this integration was not very clear from my point of view. I think it would be important for us readers of the proposal to have more knowledge about which Cardano technologies would be used in this DAO, as well as in what way. Therefore, in relation to the specific objectives of the challenge, my opinion is that the idea is very good but it is not so clear how the results we aim for in this challenge would be achieved, namely: 1) the largest number of active members in the Cardano community 2) greater number of transactions on our blockchain 3) new CNFTs (in this case this would be done through native tokens) and so on. It would be interesting for the proponents to explain a little better about the payment methods of this Dapp, to understand if they would be done with Ada, for example. I think this idea would also be interesting for the challenges of Africa and the National Dapps, since the project has a very explicit vision of benefiting the country Cameroon. \n",

      "The project roadmap is very superficial. The tenderers divide the total working time into a period of 3, 6 and 12 months, and give very short explanations about each of these intervals. I wish they had given more detailed explanations so that we could understand the process more deeply. For example, in “3 months after funding - Complete project specification and start field research”; How do you complete the project specification? Would more details about Dapp be defined? I think that ideally all details should be included in the proposal itself, so that we could understand the idea as solidly as possible. About the research on the ground, what would that be like, what would we be trying to find out here? Would a feasibility survey be carried out on, for example, which cities in the country Cameroon are most likely for this project to be successful? I think that really, this part of the project leaves something to be desired, as we don't have a full understanding of what will be ahead in development. Turning now to the budget, I think the same thing happens: we only know the basics of how the requested $15,000 would be used. It would be necessary for all parts to be better detailed. In “Team Motivations (3 Developers $150 x 12 Months): $5,500”, would the professionals involved earn $150 per month? Is this value much lower than all the salaries in the profession that I've seen on Catalyst, or is this just an extra incentive outside of the salaries? They ask for $2,000 for motorcycles, but I don't understand why, as in the impact explanation we're told that people would sign up for Dapp and use it for work. Who would use Catalyst-funded motorcycles? Anyway, about the team, this is the part that got better in the whole feasibility topic. To begin with, those involved are members of the Wada group; we already know that they are a very active group in the Cardano community, which has already submitted many proposals (and some were funded) in the Africa challenge. A certain trust is already passed by the fact that it is this group. Now, speaking individually about those involved, there is also a lot of trust in each one, since we know their names, a little of their professional background and also their linkedin profiles, so that we can see in practice work developed by them. So this topic has both good and bad sides, with both the script and the budget needing more detail. \n",

      "As far as we are informed, the auditability of the process would be carried out properly. Proposers say they will make a series of documents containing numerical data such as the number of “people seeking delivery services/month” and “motorcycle taxi-men who have joined our MVP”; the only question that should be further clarified is how they intend to disseminate both the whitepaper and the reports to the Cardano community. I think these statistics will be addressed in the monthly meetings with the IOG coordinators, but will the information be available to other members of the Cardano community? And how often will these documents be released? I think the auditability of the process is good, but it could be even better with the addition of such data. Talking about the final results, the proponents state what the expected success is for 3, 6 and 12 months (the same time intervals chosen to explain the roadmap). I think the information given here is relevant and necessary, but as with the auditability of the process, it could be clearer how the Cardano community will have access to such information. I think that an analysis could be made, based on three pillars 1) how the community of Cameroon was benefited, both in terms of facilitating deliveries and mobility, in addition to the environmental issue such as the reduction of CO2 being emitted 2) how this project would be bringing benefits to Cardano, the popularization of our blockchain, increase in the number of active members, transactions in Ada and etc 3) how would the return of Dapp itself be, that is, it would be growing, becoming popular, employing many people, a delivery method widely adopted in Cameroon? Anyway, I think that auditability in general is good, with only a few points to improve. \n",

      "This proposal presents a great idea. The problem addressed here has been addressed previously in other proposals, but without so many extensive, clear and detailed explanations. It is about creating a Dapp where people can donate money (either in cryptocurrency - Ada - or in a fiat currency) or materials to different NGOs that are promoting different campaigns. I found it very positive how the proponents portray with great specificity the complete user experience, from the moment they are viewing the campaign options to help until the moment they would receive probable rewards (NFTs, access to exclusive content, etc.). And also how they explain the journey of NGOs to obtain funding. In other words, the activities that would be carried out by different types of users in Dapp are extremely understandable, we can clearly visualize what these processes would look like after the project is launched. I found the possibility of sharing the partial results of the campaign on social networks, whether videos or photos, results that were progressively achieved through donations, very valid. I think it would be a very organic way for more people to learn about the existence of these NGOs, these projects and even Dapp, which would indirectly attract new members to the Cardano community. Another very positive point is that the proponents claim that no part of the donations would be directed to them, that is, the donors' money would go 100% to the chosen projects. However, for the application to be profitable in some way, they would offer some services such as mentoring on “Campaign Design and Platform Launch” and “Invoice Audit Service”. In other words, the proponents were very honest when they say they don't want to profit from the heart of the project, but everyone needs profit to be able to continue dedicating their time to this project, and I found the exits to be very smart and fair for all parties. As I mentioned at the beginning of my analysis, there are already other projects of the same nature, but this one differs from the moment it encourages donors through rewards to maintain a link with NGOs, always donating more and more. The proponents finish explaining the impact by speaking in an objective way the advantages of the application for both donors and NGOs. In my view, the proposal is of high value, it could add a lot to Cardano since donations could be made in Ada, probably new people would create digital wallets, while the project evolved and native tokens were also included as rewards, the uses of Cardano's technologies would be further intensified. I think the project meets the challenge's objectives very well, as it will help to expand Cardano, make our blockchain better known and respected by new audiences. \n",

      "The script of this proposal is very objective and cohesive (as well as the other parts of it). We know that the development of the project will last 1 year, and that it is divided into some phases (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 1 year). The activities that would be developed in each of these stages are listed in topics. I think from the way it is presented, we can understand very well what is to come and what small parts make up the whole. Despite this, I think that instead of dividing every 3 months, the proponents could have divided the activities into monthly intervals. This would further improve the specificity levels in our compression of the development process. However, as I said, the script is quite assertive in reporting what would happen and when. Now talking about the budget division, the total amount requested is 150 thousand dollars (a very high value), however, the proposal is very complex technically, making the value make sense. It is divided into work packages: Business development (20k/year) + Solution development (100k/year) + Marketing and communication (30k/year). I disagree that this part is presented properly. As it is an expensive value, a much greater level of detail would be required. For example, in solution development. The tasks reported are “Technical Resource Hiring and Infrastructure (Web/Application/Network)”. Each of them should be explained more extensively, how much would go for each? Which professionals would dedicate themselves here? What would your work routines be like? How many days a week would they work on it, and for how many hours? That way, we would know the amount charged for the hour of work and we would have more material to conclude if it is a fair value or not. So I think that part deserved to be reworked. Speaking now of the team presentation, the last part to be analyzed on feasibility, we are not properly introduced to the team members. We know what its principles are and what professional areas would be needed here (ie what main activities professionals would develop). But unfortunately we are not introduced individually to each. It would be necessary for us to know: their names, what each one would do, a small curriculum about them, so that we could understand which projects they have been involved in so far and also how they relate to our blockchain, if they are active members of the community and how. So, although I really like the proposal, I will unfortunately give this topic three stars, because I really think it should be restructured and improved in several ways. \n",

      "We have a lot of material that can serve as a basis for us to monitor the progress of this project; in the script, several activities are listed and we know when they would need to happen (however, as I explained, it would be more interesting if this division were smaller, in months). So we know what to monitor at what time intervals. I was dubious about the Agile methodology, which the proponents claim they will use to monitor phases and tasks. What methodology is this? By which platform would this monitoring be done? How will all this information reach the Cardano community? It would be necessary for the proponents to clarify whether, for example, the standard meetings with the IOG coordinators would generate content (qualitative and quantitative data) on the partial results, and if these would be made available to the Cardano community, and also how, that is, by Through which communication platform? Will they create a website, post it on github, in our community's telegram and discord groups? Looking now at the auditability of the final results, the definition of success is seen when “we reach a point where our platform is active so that organizations and employees can come together and build relationships in a way that both parties can benefit”. I agree that this is the ultimate goal, but how can it be measured by objective, verifiable data? I think the proponents lacked explicit more direct ways of perceiving whether success was indeed achieved for both Dapp itself and Cardano. Some ways I thought: about Dapp - it could be measured how many NGOs were benefited, how many projects, how much money/materials were donated, how many donors, how many rewards were forwarded to them and etc. And for Cardano - how did these users come to understand and relate to our blockchain? Have they become members of the Cardano community? What did you do with NFTs that were received as a reward? Did they buy more Ada to donate and also invest? In my view, a broader research was lacking, and that these results were easily scalable by all members of the ecosystem. So I think auditability is average, proponents provide a principle but not deep, specific ways to audit success. \n",

      "This idea is quite innovative, I had never seen a proposal that tried to unite the food universe with that of the NFTs. Some things in my view, like “text, video and relevant metadata like nutritional information, ingredients, cuisine genre, etc” are pretty simple to understand as they could be converted to NFT. However, the meals themselves (experience NFT?), I didn't understand how this would be transformed to the format in question. In the excerpt “try NFTs with your favorite chefs, enjoy prepared meals delivered to them by API-connected cloud kitchens and restaurants (also potential content owners), and even pay private chefs in your area to cook for them on-site.” proponents talk about this experience, but it's really not very clear to me how this could all be converted to NFTs. A very positive point of this proposal, in my view, is how the exploited market is in fact multifaceted, that is, there are many possible users for this application (\"farmers, food brands, delivery aggregators, food tasters, service providers, etc. kitchen inspection services”). This could generate a large number of new active members for the Cardano ecosystem, which already meets one of the objectives of this challenge, which is to generate Dapps that help popularize our blockchain, increasing the number of transactions on the Cardano network, such as would be the case for the NFTs coined here. Another positive point of the proposal is how the user experience is described. From what I understand, people would access the platform on the web2, that is, it would already be something they would be familiar with; however, there would be an artificial intelligence guiding their searches, so that a rich repertoire of options would be presented to them. This actually seems to be a way to generate a very interesting and engaging user experience. The proponent also details how the possible uses of the platform would be through B2C and B2B offers, that is, he details very well how the application itself would work. He also outlines several uses that could be made on the platform and possible challenges to be overcome, which I think is very positive because it demonstrates that he has the maturity to determine what the possible problems would be; this generates more preparation when it comes to overcoming them. The only observation I would like to make is about how chefs, brand owners, food tasters, in short, how service providers in this area would be able to transform their products/services into NFTs. I didn't understand very well how this would be done, if who would do this technical part would be other people/artificial intelligences. Otherwise, I think it's a great idea, a Dapp that can really help popularize the Cardano ecosystem due to the wide range of uses it will offer, and with that, the diverse group of end users it can reach. \n",

      "The script of the proposal is rather superficial. We know the phases and the main activities developed in each of them. However, it would be more appropriate for the proponents to place us more precisely on how the whole process would take place. In the first phase alone, it would take about 3 months to complete the work, and several activities would be done (a detailed business model, pitch deck and white paper + a Ux Ui Design case study on the backend for content integration /creation of NFTs for content). But how long would each of them take? Who would work on each of the aforementioned team members? It would be better for him to divide the time into smaller intervals, either monthly, or to inform exactly what time to expect for the development of each step. For example, would the UI/UX design case study be done in 1 month or more? It would also be interesting for proponents to better detail the activities themselves, this case study itself, how would it be done? How would the case to be studied be selected, and through what factors would it be studied? Now going to explain the financing, the amount requested is 9500 dollars. In my opinion, this is a very fair value, as the project is complex and involves many professionals and different activities. However, the explanation of how it would be used is superficial too, as is the script. Let's use this excerpt as an example: “$5,000 for website development, white paper, detailed business plan and proposal submission, which will be essential for seed and venture capital funding”. It's very similar to what happens in a screenplay: we're given a lot of information together, but how much would each piece of information cost in isolation? It would be necessary for the proponents to specify this better, the way it is presented to us, the budget division does not allow us to understand, for example, what salary would be attributed to the professionals involved. We also don't know how much time they would dedicate to the project, which means that we have no idea whether the hourly rate charged is fair or too high. It's probably fair, as there are a lot of people involved and the project can range from 12 to 18 months in length. In other words, a lot of work will have to be done. However, I would like this information to be passed on more securely. Now speaking in relation to the team, we do not know individualized information about each professional involved, all we know is what functions are necessary for the project to be carried out. But it would be important for us to know the names of those involved, what they have done so far professionally (a small resume that demonstrates their experiences) as well as how they relate to Cardano. So viability isn't bad, but it still has a lot to improve. \n",

      "I was a little confused about how to audit the process, because proponents say “The goals are to have all funding requirements and materials ready before the Fund9”, and we know what requirements and materials those are (Ux Ui detailed case study + Pitch deck, etc.). However, once they are funded, how could we measure the development process of this project? I think at first it's essential that they better detail the roadmap, so that the community knows exactly what to monitor. In the background, it is important for this team to keep the Cardano community always up to date on partial results, that is, the small goals that will be achieved over time. It is necessary that they define new requirements and materials that would be conquered little by little, and also that they establish when (at most) each thing would have to be delivered. My advice is that some members of the Cardano community, who feel engaged in monitoring this project more closely, can follow along with the technical team and provide periodic feedback to the rest of the community. Now in terms of the final results, the proponents provide a very detailed picture of what success would look like, and this is very good as it gives us solid insight into what needs to be achieved. However, it is unclear how this information would reach members of the Cardano ecosystem. I think it would be necessary that somehow (either by a written report or by a meeting after Town Hall, for example) the proponents would explain whether the intended results were obtained through direct surveys with the service providers who used Dapp; we also need to know how this project impacted Cardano in practice, if an increase in the number of transactions on our blockchain was observed; if indeed the number of NFTs minted in Cardano has grown significantly; whether we have new Ada holders, and so on. All this must be observed, reported, proven and made available to members of the Cardano community. So what I think about auditability: it's on track, we know what to monitor, but proponents need to define new metrics to be noticed during progress and specify how the community will be able to know the information mentioned as final results. \n",

      "The proposal fits well with what the challenge seeks, although it does not seem to me to have as much impact on the social/beneficent bias, which from what I understand is one of the fundamental pillars of this challenge. The project here is about creating a Dapp that, in the author’s own words, provides an “upload of legal documents (if necessary)”, that are easily read by users, and are minted on the Cardano blockchain via smart contracts. . The purpose of this new platform would really be to facilitate document attachment in various cases (it would be interesting if the proponent could cite some examples of using Dapp. houses, I don't know?). It seems to me to be a platform that is quite versatile, and precisely because it has so many usage options, it would be useful for the proponent to explain with practical examples how Dapp would work for people. This project is certainly very beneficial for Cardano, because it would allow a series of documents to be minted on our blockchain, payments would be made in Ada as well, that is, a practical way of how our technologies could be used would be generated. This would be a gateway for new people to get to know Cardano and maybe become adept at the facilities that our blockchain provides, that is, I realize that this Dapp would be a good way to popularize Cardano. My biggest doubt in terms of impact would be how it aligns with the objectives of the specific challenge, to mine here we want to finance projects that have a strong social nature, that help the economies of developing countries prosper, that are able to facilitate and benefit the lives of those who are most in need, either through different types of aid. I think this Dapp is going to be very beneficial for Cardano and also for its end users, but I'm not so sure about the more social impact as I said at the beginning of my review. Therefore, I will give 4 stars for the impact of the proposal, precisely because I still have doubts about these more humanitarian applications of the project, which in my view are what differentiates this challenge from that of Dapps and applications. \n",

      "The feasibility of the project is ok, we generally know information about the roadmap, budget and team, but they could be described in more detail. In the case of the script, first, it says the tasks that would be done so that in the end the Dapp would be ready and complete. Each of these tasks is also explained better, even if they are just summary topics. In fact, the project is very technical so not all CAs will understand this process from the information that has been provided, but at least the proponents are concerned with placing us on the process. What remained pending was a better established temporal notion. We don't know exactly how long each of these tasks would take, so it was difficult to understand the phases. It would be important that, together with the presentation of the tasks, the proponent inform us in how long, approximately, they would be executed. Would each one take weeks, or months to complete? Would they all happen next, or maybe some could run in parallel? These notions were a little abstract, I always indicate that the script contains a good description of the tasks to be performed as well as deadlines to be obeyed. Now talking about the team, I thought this part of the proposal was great, we know who those involved are and information about them such as their names, roles, professional experiences, etc. It's positive that some people here have experience with Cardano, as it gives more security that the technologies in our ecosystem are executed correctly. My suggestion is for everyone to attach a link where we could see more of their work in practice, as happens with Michał in gitlab. In this way, trust in the team would be further emphasized. Finally, regarding the budget: the asking value is considerably high, however the project is complex, many professionals would be working here and many tasks would need to be performed. With this, the need for a large investment is justified. The explanation of the parts is good, it is known about each part of the budget, how much it would cost and why, although some parts, especially the more expensive ones, such as the “environment for uploading and signing documents in Cardano” (which would cost 20k alone) should have been better detailed. Thus, we would understand the reason for the requested value for them. So I think feasibility has strengths, especially in the team presentation part, but it could also make some improvements to make it perfect. \n",

      "The auditability suggested by the proponent would verify the success of the project objectively and accurately, but not completely. As a success, the scenario outlined by him was that people sign documents on his platform, SaaS automated tests are established and at least 1 large organization uses AdaSign to sign their contracts, eliminating the bureaucracy. In fact, these are very direct statistics by which we can get a sense of whether the project is being embraced, that is, if its use is being done as planned. But in addition to how many people used this new technology, a user satisfaction survey could be carried out. That way we would know what these people would be thinking of the new functionality, if they genuinely achieved the goal of dispensing with the bureaucracy that involves reading and signing documents, if they started to adopt Cardano's technologies for other things too, such as if they are investing in Ada or using the blockchain to mint NFTs... Finally, to understand what impact this proposal had on the lives of these people, both in relation to AdaSign and through external means. The proponent does not suggest how to audit the process, I suggest that, as I said before, he includes dates in the elaboration of the roadmap and also that he establish a direct contact with the Cardano community, in order to provide gradual feedback on the progress of the process. This can be done either through the preparation of reports (monthly, for example), or in meetings through video calls, which could take place in specific rooms to follow up on funded proposals after the Town Hall sessions, in short... different ways to establish this bridge, the important thing is that we are constantly updated on the status of things.

      "It is not clear how this proposal will meet what we are looking for in the present challenge. It is about creating a DAO, which will revolve around the music world, where there will be various activities such as connecting musicians and services, promoting the bridge between studios (these first two activities are already happening); to play the role of a social network focused on the music world (this could be better explained here), in short, to promote a decentralized economy where investors, musicians, recorders and consumers could interact and establish agreements, sales and various types of contracts. This is what I understood would be done in the application. Regarding how all this would relate to the Cardano ecosystem, this part is explained briefly in the following paragraph: “create use cases for DAO Governance, Payments, NTF, Smart Contracts for Gigs, DeFi, Services”. Unfortunately, the explanation, as you can see, is very short, it is not explained in detail how the technologies of the Cardano ecosystem would be used. We know that they would be, because it is mentioned that NFT would be in play, smart contracts (which would logically be done on the Cardano blockchain), but not explained, for example, NFTs of what, would it be something that musicians would make available to their fans? Like unique album covers, artwork related to your work? What would these smart contracts be made for exactly? Who would be selling what service/product? Could this DAO be a kind of cryptographic Spotify, where musicians would receive a fairer amount for playing their songs? Despite being an idea that theoretically is promising, the explanation of the impact is still a little abstract, in my perception. If the internal workings of the application were better explained and how exactly it would use Cardano's technologies, I believe it would be easier to measure the impact, if the proposal is in line with what we are looking for here.

Starting off that I'm not sure what M1/M2 etc would be, I believe it's month 1 and 2, so I'll start from that assumption to continue my analysis. The proponent starts by explaining the main activities to be carried out from month 1 to 6, but this is done in a somewhat loose and superficial way. First it states what would be focused on the first and second month and then it focuses on the third to sixth month range. Below he writes some more activities to be developed in this period, at least that's what I understood (that these activities would be part of this block of time). But it is not possible to know exactly what would happen in month 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on. That is, I would prefer that the proponent had organized these activities in a linear and clear way, in order to resolve any doubts about at what point in the process each thing would happen. It would also be interesting to include the expected time to perform each task, this would also help to visualize more clearly what is to come. The same explanation format continues to follow, ranging for example from months 7 to 13, 14 to 20 and so on. In short, my opinion about the script is that we even get to know what is going to happen and roughly when, but not exactly when. The level of detail is quite complete in some time intervals, raising the level of this proposal. This makes understanding not the best possible. Moving on to another point of analysis, when it comes to the budget, this part is very problematic in my opinion. From what I could understand, each time interval would need a lot (a lot!) of investment, for example only in M1 and M2 it would be 131,396 USD. This is very expensive, the total project would cost more than 2 million dollars, which is close to what IOHK decided to invest in this Dapps challenge, which is an extremely high value. How would the project be financed from now on? If it was successful in the current fund, would it also be submitted in future funds? The first two months, which cost 131k, would like an explanation for the need for this money, that is, the bidder should justify it in parts (amount X would go to design, Y to programming and so on), in order to argue because it is a necessary amount. And finally, when it comes to the team, this is said in a confusing way. We have the names and linkedin profiles of some professionals, which allows us to get to know them in practice and is very positive, but we do not know who will do what in the project. Some functions are described below, it is not possible to understand if these would be the functions of the professionals mentioned above or of people they still want to hire.

It is said that the achieved milestones can be verified in a public gitlab and also through the already active products, this would require a community effort to follow the project. I think it would be more appropriate if the team itself made reports with a summary of monthly progress, for example, and made them available to the Cardano community. In terms of success, it could be easily verified because the proponent makes clear numerous of his objectives and goals, both numerically (he wants to increase the number of current users of his application by 10x) and qualitatively through what should happen (in case of success) until the year 2030. KPIs are also traced, that is, there are several ways to exercise auditability. It is, in a way, possible to monitor the process also through the activities mentioned in the viability in the respective months, but as I said, because they are not located in time exactly, this is a little more difficult. If the schedule were revised and improved, I would give this item the highest score, but as in my opinion the analysis of the final products is 100% possible and the analysis of the processes is not, I will give it 4 stars; improving communication between the Cardano team and community and establishing probable dates for the start and end of each task, in each of the phases, would improve the monitoring of the proposal. \n",

      "The theory of the proposal is great, adding 100 new members to the Cardano community, bringing them together and instructing them about what Cardano is, what are the opportunities offered by our blockchain, such as: programmers learn plutus and get employed in any of the Catalyst projects, where such labor is highly needed; advertisers and designers alike work for projects; people who do not have these more common formations of project team members, working as CAs and vCAs...). This proposal certainly meets in theory the objective of bringing new people into our ecosystem, as we know that in most cases Cardano is unknown (except in places where blockchain is already more widespread, such as the United States and Europe). This would certainly be beneficial for Cardano, since in addition to new workers in the projects, the investment in our blockchain would probably also grow, either by the increase in the purchase of Ada, Ada being delegated, CNFTs bought and sold, number of digital wallets created and etc. The problem is that it is not explained exactly how these 100 new members would be onboarded into the community, in the feasibility part there are several actions that would be taken, such as “active pre-onboarding campaigns and information about the value of the catalyst / welcome meeting”. must be powerful, share Cardano's vision” and many others. However, the problem I identify here is that these actions are not well located in time and space. We know which team involved would be the East African decentralized alliance, which leads us to believe that the project would be in that geographic region, but in which country? Who would be the target audience, that is, which people exactly are we targeting to create this group of 100 people? How long would each of these actions take and when are they planned to take place? In short, I think the idea is a good one, but putting it into practice is still a bit confusing through the information given. With that, I'll be neutral about the impact. This part of the proposal could give more confidence with the details I mentioned a little while ago. \n",

      "As I explained on impact, I think the script here is good in the sense of letting us know what is going to happen, but not in what way or how. It would be necessary to understand how long this project would take to happen. The explanations provided for each of the two months are very superficial, it would take more detailing of the activities, it would also be great to understand for weeks what actions would be developed. I would also like to know which alliance members would do which things, and where, for example, the meetings would take place. Since they will be face-to-face, where will they take place? And what group of people will you organize, with the aim of also receiving whom? How would the teachings on Cardano be transmitted? What topics would be covered and in what order? I believe we would start with the basics, such as what is blockchain, Cardano, NFT, digital wallet and other more primary technologies of our ecosystem. But unfortunately the bidder does not specify any of this information. Therefore, I believe that the roadmap should be reformulated, including deadlines and more detail on each of the actions. Regarding the budget, I also think that this part should be better explained, despite the fact that the money requested is very cheap compared to the other proposals, this does not exclude the need for detailing how much will be used. For example, most of that money would go to the host. He or she would receive 1600 USD. But why? What would that person do? What tasks would she be responsible for during the month? How many hours of work would she do a day? Would your journey be Monday through Friday? And finally, about the team, we are told that they would be the members of the East African decentralized alliance and that they have launched several proposals previously and some of them have already been funded. However, it would be necessary to know them individually, so that we have a real idea of ​​who we are dealing with and if they are qualified for the project. We would need to know their names, CVs, how they relate to Cardano (we know they are part of an active group in the community, but what are they doing?), what roles they would play here (from what I could understand it would be just one person from the group working on the project, but who, and what would she do?). That is, all the detail that is provided about team members Victor, Antony and Angela. Anyway, it's very complicated to trust a team that we don't fully know. Therefore, I think that in terms of feasibility, the proposal is not bad, but some things should be reviewed. \n",

      "Regarding the progress of the project, I think that auditability is possible, because the proponent lists several activities that must be fulfilled so that we can consider that the planned things are actually happening. As we have such activities in a linear order, it is easier to monitor this. What is really missing is the issue of dates and deadlines within the months. If we had an exact idea of ​​how long each thing would last, we could better understand the whole. It would be important for the proponent to define, for example, that by the 15th, half of the promised activities would have been fulfilled. It would be great to know the exact days the meetings would take place. Another suggestion I would like to make is that some member of the Cardano community, who was native to the place where the project would be focused, follow the entire process, both the online parts and the face-to-face meetings, and bring this feedback to the rest of the Cardano community. through any of the various communication channels that we have. And about the final results, unfortunately this part is very unspecific, we know that the goal is to ship 100 new members to the Cardano community, but how would we know that this result was achieved? It would be essential for the proponent to prepare a final report, when the project has been completed, gathering all the data that demonstrate that the goal has been met: how many digital wallets were created, how many people attended the meetings, if these people actually entered the Cardano ecosystem , and if so, in what way... Anyway, we need to know in detail how this all happened. Preferably, someone participating in the project also gives their opinion on everything, telling their account of how this initiative reached him and how it reached his colleagues, for example. Therefore, I think that auditability is good only in relation to the process, and even in this part it is not ideal because the dates are absent, the temporal notion given is a little vague. Unfortunately, about the end goal, not enough detail is given so that we could really safely monitor the consequences of this project. \n",

      "It is possible to clearly understand the purpose of this proposal by the passage “we intend to allow users to seamlessly use the Milkomeda dApps for Cardano from their mobile device, giving Cardano access to a new user base that will increase adoption and attract more users to the platform”. Unfortunately, the proponents still make the information about these Milkomoeda apps very abstract. What are these Dapps? Since they already adopt Ada, how? Are sales, purchases made? It's games, what exactly do people do with these Dapps? How many? I think the proponents should have provided this basic information to us, we were unable to understand what the works are currently being carried out and that they intend to evolve through this proposal. Due to this lack of explanations, we do not know if the objectives of the challenge will be achieved. We aim to finance Dapps that contribute to the popularization of our blockchain, through the creation of new digital wallets (as the proponents claim would happen), increase in the number of CNFTs minted on the Cardano blockchain, sum of new active members, etc. Anyway, it may even be that these things happen, however it is not very clear how; it would be necessary for us to understand what happens with the use of these Dapps, so that we can understand who the target audience is (the average number of users and their profile); so that we had a good understanding of how this project would benefit Cardano and meet the specific objectives of the challenge. Therefore, due to the lack of general understanding of the proposal, the impact is very low. \n",

      "We don't have a script here. Proponents give only a cursory idea of ​​the activities that would be done along the way ('We plan to have a mobile integration POC with Milkomeda by the end of Q1 2022 and start work on the dApp connector for mobile devices in early Q2 of 2022 with release in Q3 2022”). But this explanation is very succinct and doesn't specify well the tasks that will be done so that, for example, the integration is done, the connector is created and the public release is possible. Ideally, proposers would draw a timeline, in which they would explain a) what would be done b) when it would be done - that is, the month, or even the weeks c) who would do it d) how it would be done. If we had such information, we would be able to understand exactly how the development process of this project would take place, which does not happen. Now talking about the $25,000 funding request, once again the proponents don't say how that part would be managed. How would the total amount be divided? It is said that “it will be used in the R&D effort for developers to create how to use Milkomeda dApps from a mobile device and then program the implementation”, however, this explanation is not only too short but too technical. The proposal's readers would probably not understand well what the proposers mean by this - I include myself in this portion, I'm not from the Dapps development area, it was very inaccessible to me what would be done after all. We would need to understand where this money would go, of course I think it would be used in the salaries of the professionals involved, but we don't know, for example, how much each one would receive per month and how many hours they would dedicate to this project, so we have no way of concluding if the amount requested is fair or abusive. Finally, speaking of the team itself, once again the necessary information is unfortunately lacking. We don't know who the professionals are who would work here, nor their names, their resumes and examples of previous projects (the Milkomoeda Dapps themselves should have been explained); with this, it is not possible to understand if they have the technical preparation for this project.

      "Proponents claim that progress can be measured from the 3-step analysis: “be able to access your Milkomeda wallet on mobile, define the standard we will use to connect to the dApps and implement the standard”. However, again the information given is very superficial, we don't understand exactly how these analyzes would be done from each part of the project as a whole; it is also unclear how this information would reach members of the Cardano community. In my view, to improve this, the roadmap should be better detailed, from which monthly reports should be generated that identify whether the activities planned for each period of time were fulfilled, if partial results were achieved, etc.; and all this should be made available in a simple and direct way to all members of the Cardano ecosystem. The explanation of the auditability of the final results is also insufficient, we only know that the ultimate goal is for many people to start adopting Cardano through Dapps on their mobile devices, but this goal is already clear from the impact. There would need to be several smaller goals, measurable data, that would allow our community members to understand if this was achieved and how. How can we tell if new members have been added to our community, if they are active, and if so, what do they do? It would be essential for proponents to carry out such a study, it could be an analysis of the number of downloads of Dapps created, a study of how users would be relating to Cardano's technologies present there, if really new wallets were created, the purchase and Ada augmented and etc. Therefore, I think that the proposal is not auditable, the proposers do not provide good information on how we could perceive success, nor do they inform by which means of communication (telegram groups, discord, Town Hall and etc) this data would be shared with all of us. \n",

      "This Dapp fully meets the objectives of the challenge because it intends to bring a very busy and important market - real estate - into the technologies of the Cardano ecosystem, since the objective here is to establish real estate negotiations through smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain. It is also positive that the author intends to carry out various actions through cryptocurrencies and blockchain, such as loans, payment of rents and leasing of real estate in cryptocurrencies. However, as it would still be a very new activity (in fact, I have never heard of any case in the real estate market that used the technologies of the cryptographic world), it is positive that the author (and his team) is aware of starting by giving the first step, which would be the direct sale of properties. In fact, I believe that if this project is financed and developed properly, it can bring many benefits to Cardano, increasing the number of transactions on the blockchain, digital wallets (I don't know if it would increase the number of Ada holders because from what I read, these transactions have been made in USDT). Another positive point here is that the author is aware that the implementation of the activity he proposes is not so simple, due to the fact that some countries still do not allow cryptographic transactions, so he proposes to start where this could be more possible. I believe that with the advancement of legislation in relation to cryptocurrencies (an issue so important that I even constituted a challenge in this fund), these activities could expand to more and more countries, even when this starts to happen in real life and investors realize the various advantages of owning cryptocurrencies and carrying out transactions on the blockchain. However, I identified an issue here that needs to be considered: I think the author of the proposal could have explained more clearly how he intends to bring this technology in a simple and accessible way to the general public, to those who are not yet part of the ecosystem or who may do not know concepts from the cryptographic world other than the famous ones, such as NFT or the existence of Bitcoin. If this issue were better clarified, I have the impression that we would have more confidence in the success of this proposal and how it would exactly achieve the objectives of the proposed challenge. \n",

      "Unfortunately, in my view, this part of the proposal has a lot to improve. Starting on the project roadmap. The author of the proposal claims that it is difficult to predict in detail what will happen after funding because it depends on external partners. But it gets very complicated for the community to choose to fund a project where we know next to nothing about what will happen next. As hard as this is to predict, the appropriate thing would be for the author to get in touch with his partners (it would also be necessary to present who they would be) and together come up with a roadmap on what would happen in the case of successful funding. It just informs with short sentences what would happen in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th quarter of the year. But this information is extremely superficial and not well explained. For example, in the first time block, “MVP development and testnet launch” would take place. These technical activities are not known to all CAs and Catalyst voters, it would be important for the author to explain them in simple language so that they are accessible to everyone. So, about the script, I feel that a complete reformulation would be necessary, so that we could understand exactly what would happen after the funding. Regarding the financial distribution, it is also very superficial, the author only says that 98% would be for product development and the rest for various fees. But within that 98%, how would the money be divided? The author mentions which activities would compose the development of the product in the auditability, but even so, we do not know which professionals would be involved here, which activities they would perform and so on. As it is presented to us, we cannot get a solid view of how the requested money would be spent. It is necessary for the author to break down much more, dividing the total amount into small parts and justifying the need for each of them. And finally, as far as the author's ability to successfully execute this project is concerned, I believe this is the safest part of this topic. Due to the fact that it has already been financed, it already has a series of activities developed previously, as he mentions in the “it's good to know” part, where we have knowledge of what has been done so far within this project, confidence is transmitted in your job. There is also a short description of who the author is, containing his name, professional occupation and some of his activities. It would be interesting, however, if we had more clarity regarding his connection with Cardano: how does this person relate to our blockchain? Are the technical parts about Cardano performed by someone else on the team, if so, who? Even though it has already been financed at f4, this relationship is not so clear to me. It would be nice if it were better explained. Therefore, on this topic of the proposal, I believe that the explanation of the script and the use of funding need a lot of improvement, with the author's knowledge being the part that most conveys confidence in success. \n",

      "Here the author mentions which activities would be necessary for the development of the product, but I think it would be important for him to situate who would carry them out and also when they would happen. Knowing what would happen is the basis for monitoring the process, but it is not the only information needed. As it is presented to us, we do not have complete control to verify that what was promised was being fulfilled by those who owe it, at the right time and in the right way. It is also not possible to audit the financial breakdown as it lacks so much detail, as I explained in the previous topic. In the same way, success is described very briefly, we basically know what each component of the project (buyer, seller and broker) would do for the project to be considered successful. It would be interesting if the author detailed the activities of each type of user in greater detail. It would also be positive if a kind of satisfaction survey were carried out, for example, to find out how the experience of each of these users was: are they satisfied with this project? Interested in learning more about the cryptographic world? Did they hear about Cardano specifically? As I understand it, the smart contracts would be on our blockchain, but the currency used would not be Ada, so I think to what extent users would have direct contact with Cardano, in order to understand its differentials and advantages. I suggest that the author promote this type of research, gathering the data and bringing it to the rest of the community. In addition to user satisfaction, monitoring could be carried out on the expansion of the project, that is: the author says he intends to start these activities in the United Arab Emirates and then expand it to other countries. Did this really happen? On what scale was the real estate market reached by this proposal, would this project be an incentive for this alternative way of negotiating real estate? Unfortunately, despite having basic information on auditability, I felt a lack of greater coverage in relation to how we can track the results, both on a micro (users) and macro scale (in which countries would the activity be happening and what impact for the sector's investors). \n",

      "The proposal is very simple and extremely useful. It is about translating into French an application that already exists, an application that works to help people in the staking process. When translating into French, this would certainly increase the engagement of French speakers with one of the ecosystem's main activities. It is true that French is a highly spoken language on the African continent, so it will certainly benefit the continent, as it will facilitate this very important activity for its inhabitants, while also clearly benefiting the Cardano ecosystem, bringing in new users from Africa, thus achieving the specific objectives of the challenge. This also relates to the other challenge, of bringing new people to Cardano. The language barrier is certainly the one that makes the expansion of our blockchain the most difficult, and if we can gradually break it, Cardano's primary goals will certainly be achieved. The author has included two direct ways of proving the existence and work of the application he cites - we have the link that directs to the site and also a short video about the project.

As much as it has already been translated into other languages, it is important to understand how this process happens. Regarding the budget, I don't think there is more to be detailed, since it is a very small amount compared to the funding requested by most applicants, and it is very clear how it will be used. But in relation to the professionals involved, it is said that the main developer already has a lot of experience in the area and that he has applications with millions of downloads. Okay, but who is this person? What apps has he developed? I had to present it properly. Was it the author of the proposal? About the translation, who would be responsible for this part? The author claims that a professional translator or translator will be hired, but do we already have candidates in mind? And if so, what examples of previous work?

      "The progress of this project is quite simple to trace, I see two paths. The first would be, as the author himself comments, to talk about the amount of downloads on the apple store/google play in French. This would be a direct indicator of how the application is being adopted/popularized by the target audience. It would be possible for the Cardano community to monitor this in a very simple way, accessing such information on their cell phones. A complement would also be to follow the translation process, I believe it should not be long, I suggest that some member of the French speaking community make use of the application and bring us this feedback, if everything is working well and as promised, if it is entirely translated and ergonomically arranged. Another idea is that the author of the proposal brings us some statistics, have French speakers in Africa intensified their activities with the pools? Has there been an increase in membership? There are other suggestions to be made for a full understanding of the project result.

      "I think this proposal can work but it is also quite risky. The idea is, from what I understand, to create animated video content that teaches the public about Cardano and its technologies in an accessible way, and also promotes actions on the street with well-known personalities, in order to draw the attention of those who pass by; while these actions were established, video fragments would be recorded in order to compose a short documentary to be shown later. That's what I got from the project. In theory, I think it's something quite innovative, different from what we see in the other proposals (at least so far) of this challenge, as this project promises to promote a further level of interaction between the team, the public and what Cardano is all about, mainly through face-to-face meetings. However, a number of factors concern me here about how this project would look in practice. We know that these meetings would take place in Brazil, but it is not specified in which cities, much less in which streets, in which parts of the neighborhoods, etc. I think it would be important for us to know the exact location of these events, as it is a crucial point for the success of the project. It would be necessary for these meetings to be held in busy but at the same time safe places, so that the team could use their photography and sound capture equipment in a carefree way, for example, but at the same time they were busy enough corners for it to be possible. interact with a good number of people. Another thing, I am a little in doubt about whether it is really a good idea to promote these events in such a spontaneous way, I think it can go very well or very wrongly, because 1) people are usually in a hurry, they are not available to stop and learn about new things as they go from one corner to another, especially if we're talking about big cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. How would the team be able to attract these people, keep their attention? 2) I think it's already complicated to do a street action in relation to well-known issues, for example, here in my city I've been out on a Sunday for a walk and saw a campaign to raise awareness of animal rights. It was people handing out flyers and calling for conversation, and there wasn't much audience retention. I am unsure whether people would want to stop in their tracks to hear about something that is unknown to most, and also why people still have a certain prejudice towards blockchain. Thus, the question remains whether they would really be interested in participating in the actions. I think that if the team had explained better how they would do these actions, for example, who would these well-known people, musicians, artists, etc., be that they intend to hire? How would these personalities be educated about what Cardano is and how would they get that message across to the public? Apart from the participation of these well-known people, what else would make up these events? Distribution of pamphlets, promotional materials? What is the content that the team intends to record from these moments? We have to take into account that most people do not feel comfortable in front of the cameras and would probably not allow the use of their images, especially if they would only be there to know what it is about and would not be automatically involved in the cause. . Therefore, there are several doubts that came to me about the execution and, consequently, the impact of this project, it may be that yes, all this will work out and through this project we will be able to disseminate content related to Cardano in different media from those we already have a good audience. , but it may also be not. \n",

      "Regarding the feasibility of the project, I believe that some things are well explained here but others need improvement. For example, several things are said that would be part of the project development process, that is, tasks to be performed in order to develop a whole. They would be the pre-production (agenda development, team formation, registration in social networks, etc), the production itself (where there would already be educational content about blockchain ready, the face-to-face events would take place as well as their recording to promote social networks and continue to promote Cardano) and post production, where all video content would be posted, shared and partnership attempts made. We were able to clearly understand what would be done, but not when. In other words, I think that to improve this part of the proposal, it would be necessary to establish a more specific roadmap, which would also include how long each developed activity would last and probable dates. With this, we would have a much better understanding of the whole, as we would be able to relate activities with deadlines to be met. Regarding the budget, in my opinion the asking value is too high and not compatible with the project's needs, I think I could even agree better with this value if the parties had been better explained, justifying the need for such an investment. For example, half the money (15k) would be for various things: employees, equipment rental, domain registration and website creation. How much would go for such a thing, and why? How many employees would there be? What is the value of your working hours? Exactly what equipment would be leased, and from where? Could it be that all the events would take place in the same city and with that they already have in mind somewhere to rent equipment? How much would domain and website creation cost? Likewise, the other parts could be better detailed, such as why marketing would cost 5k USD, what is the project's dissemination strategy, etc. And finally, speaking now of the team involved, I thought this part was good but there is also room for improvement. The names, roles and a little history of each team member are told, so that we can get to know them in a satisfactory way, but I think that some profile should be included on social networks or on sites like vimeo, linkedin, through which we could see the work of those involved in practice. The team is made up of artists, audiovisual professionals, design, marketing and so on, that is, it is essential to see some examples of their previous work to know who we are actually dealing with. Some vimeo links are attached, but I would like to see, for example, the portfolios of those responsible for the design. What worries me here is also the fact that we don't have any Cardano experts on the team, how do we know that someone really knowledgeable about the subject will support the team, that information related to the Cardano ecosystem is real, up to date and reliable? Therefore, I think it would be essential for someone here to play this role, the team could partner with someone who has proven this knowledge. \n",

      "I think the proposal is reasonably auditable in terms of the process and very much in terms of results. I say this because, about the process, the team tells us in a very abstract way how we could track the progress of this project. It is said that in the first month what would have to be monitored is the creation of social networks and the establishment of partnerships, while from the second to the sixth month there would be several things, but in summary: the face-to-face actions and their recordings, the launch of video content and the movement of social networks. I think they should have detailed the progress expectations on a monthly basis, because from month 2 to 6 is a very long time with a lot of things happening, and without specifying with clarity what would happen in each month those members of the Cardano community who were going to audit the proposal would be a little lost on how to work, what would have to be ready at a certain point and so on. I would like that in the feasibility part they would build this schedule related to dates, so that we could have a sense of deadlines and if things were being done within the expected time. Regarding the results, I think it's a very simple proposal to audit because basically all the content here would be released, made known to the public instantly, so it's very simple to monitor whether the partial results are being delivered or not. I see two distant ways of auditing the results: the entire Cardano community, or anyone interested, could periodically check the project's social networks, in order to monitor the videos that would be coming out as well as the reach and audience interaction; community members who lived in the cities where the actions were to take place could participate, and with that, bring impartial feedback on how the moment was, if there was good public support, if the team clearly and correctly disclosed information about Cardano and etc. With that, I think we could monitor the proposal in a very complete way; my suggestion is here about the dates in the schedule. \n",

      "The idea is theoretically good, but it lacks a lot of explanation here. Let's start by analyzing if the proposal fits with the objectives of the challenge: I don't think so. The goal of this challenge is to produce content about the Cardano ecosystem and disseminate it on different media platforms, preferably traditional media and go beyond platforms (such as youtube) that our blockchain already has a good foundation for, and this would all be done with the objective of making Cardano known and understood by a new and different audience than usual. I think that the proposal does not fit into this, because its idea is to bring exclusive content from the music world to the Cardano blockchain, through NFTs, with the intention that people are forced to use the technologies of our ecosystem if they do. want access to it. In my analysis, this can work if the content taken to the blockchain is from large, very famous artists who have enough engagement to make their audience seek to learn new things (how to acquire an NFT, how to make transactions on the blockchain and etc) to consume these unique songs. This might or might not bring a new audience to Cardano, but I don't think it would be as effective as, for example, creating content that is aimed directly at media like radio and TV. That way, people don't need to go beyond what they already do to get to know Cardano, understand what it is and how it can be beneficial, which would cause new participants to enter our community. Do you know what I mean? I believe that we need to make it easier for the goals of this challenge to be really achieved, and not force the public to learn about Cardano in order to get some content they want, because in my view this would work for those who are already familiar with blockchain and cryptography; I'm not really sure that older people, people who don't know anything about blockchain, let alone Cardano, have the energy and interest to do this. In my view, this idea would fit more into the Dapps challenge, because if this were all done from Dapp, it could help create a relevant application that could make a difference for Cardano, since the monetization problem in large streaming services it is something real, which has already been mentioned several times in Catalyst and that certainly deserves investments and that projects are made about it. Even so, I think the proponent should have detailed his idea better, we know what would happen, but we have no idea: which artists would participate in the project, how they would be convinced to do so, how the public would be taught to acquire NFT to access the these contents, how many tracks are intended to be released in NFT, approximately, by which platform the whole project would be developed (would it be a Dapp, by computer...?). Anyway, it's still very abstract what would happen and how, in addition to that, as I explained, I'm not sure that the proposal fits the challenge so well. \n",

      "The feasibility of the project is not good, we don't have any kind of roadmap attached, the proponent states he would like there to be: “3 monthly music releases (for sale, not airdrops) from Humble Records artists / 500 Total Sales Volume ADA / 50 Total UBI ADA dispersed per month, as well as participants”. But how would that be achieved? It would be necessary for him to explain which phases would make up the whole of the project, which activities would make up each phase, how long these activities would take to start and finish... For example, phase 1: in the first month, contact artists, select track that would be released on the Cardano blockchain, start building the NFTs access platform, create a guide on how to use these technologies (aimed at end consumers)... . Thus, understanding the process is unfeasible, all we have are the goals, we do not know how we can reach them. Regarding the budget, 1500 USD is requested to carry out the project, which is a very small and affordable amount compared to the funding requested by the other proposals. However, it is not very clear how this money would be used. It is said to be the salary of the creators, who would move “arts-centric Twitter spaces to grow the arts community in Cardano”. But what about the other things? What rewards would artists receive for stepping out of their comfort zones and benefiting our blockchain? Who would work on the technical side of things, developing smart contracts, building a Dapp (it's not clear if it would be built, but anyway) how would the people who are going to develop Cardano's technologies get paid? Regarding the team, the names and a small curriculum of those who would be involved in the project are presented, however, some things are still very uncertain. For example, what would be the role of each one in this project? Who would program here, who would work on the technical side of things? Do people who have something to do with blockchain have any direct connection with the Cardano ecosystem, if so, which one? Are they active members of the community? It seems to me that, in general, they are artists and musicians, who are undoubtedly the key pieces for the realization of the project, but we would also need programmers, designers, publicists... These professionals are indispensable for the creation of basically all projects. of Catalyst, and in this case it is no different. Anyway, unfortunately I think that the information about the script, the explanation of the budget and the presentation of the team left a lot to be desired, making this proposal a little difficult to be viable. \n",

      "The auditability of the project is also not good. Proponents do not tell us reliable ways to monitor the progress and final results of this project. About the progress, what would the Audition Rooms be? And how do they relate to it all? I think that first a linear, detailed and well-placed roadmap would need to be established, so that we know exactly what we are auditing and how certain rules must be respected. In the background, it would be necessary to establish frequent contact between this team, their work and the Cardano community, whether through a Notion (organization application where you can share a series of things), a github, a google docs, meetings on video... Finally, a way to make this contact direct and effective, allowing the Cardano community to vigorously monitor the achievement of partial results and the progress of the stages. And as for the end results, what the proponents include here is exactly the same thing we found in the previous topic, feasibility. Do they intend to release just 3 songs with this funding? Would the sale at 500 adas refer to these 3 NFTs, or something else? What would UBI ADA be? As it is a proposal that is not well explained, I find it difficult to suggest ways to audit the results, but here goes. An individual follow-up of the artists who agreed to participate in this adventure could be done, in order to understand if they were satisfied with the results and intend to launch more content on the Cardano blockchain. It could be measured if from this project new people created digital wallets, bought Ada, somehow started to use the technologies of our ecosystem, in short: if this proposal helped him to become more popular. It would be interesting to see if there is any kind of impact on the music sector, that is, if more artists show interest in releasing their content in NFT, if they believe that this way can be generally more advantageous for them... In general, I I think the proposal is not easily auditable, the proponents lacked definition of what would need to be monitored in more detail, how the project development process could be followed, and not just the final products, and what would be the platform (bridge) that would allow the community to do that. \n",

      "This is a great proposition that certainly applies to the goals of the challenge. The idea is to translate to Sualí an application that helps people buy Ada and delegate it to some community pool, the application already exists and is well evaluated in the apple store and google play, that is, we will not be betting on the unknown. This directly achieves the objectives of the challenge because at the same time it will benefit Swali speakers (note: I have already seen some proposals aimed at this language in other funds, I did some research and found that one of the most important dialects in Africa, so certainly is very useful to invest in it), it will also help our Cardano blockchain to expand to new horizons. It's important that we make Cardano more accessible to everyone, and language is without a doubt the biggest barrier we face. As stated in the challenge, most pools are located either in the United States or in Europe, if we invest in taking this knowledge to other languages, we will be investing so that in the long term people from different parts of the world can enter the Cardano ecosystem and who knows, become involved enough to create their own pools. A suggestion that I can make for this specific project and include a small guide, which can be in text, video or images format, explaining the main concepts of our ecosystem. For example, if a person who has never heard of Cardano downloads the app out of curiosity, they will be able to understand at least the basics - what is blockchain, cryptocurrency, a pool, etc. That said, I believe that we should finance this proposal, it meets well what we are looking for in the challenge and is not complicated to execute. \n",

      "Despite being a simple execution proposal, it would be interesting to include more details in this part. For example, the author of the proposal does not specify how long the application translation process would take more or less. It would be nice to set aside some time, so that we can situate ourselves, for example: the project will take place in two months, week 1 being this, week 2 that and so on. It would also be beneficial if we knew who will do the translation, the Swali language is of indisputable importance but I believe it is not as quick to find a professional translator for it, as it would be for Spanish or French for example, because there are many people working with the translation of those languages. Therefore, the author could have included how the selection process for this translator would go, or better yet, if he has someone in mind, introduce that person and their resume. I also missed thinking a little about marketing. We can't expect Swali speakers to take the initiative to play the app's name on the play store/apple store, right? It would be more prudent to draw up a dissemination plan, through which the target audience could get to know and get involved with the app. In this way, we would be even more certain that the desired impact was being achieved. Regarding the developer, it would also be important to know who he is, what his relationship with the Cardano ecosystem is and also a little history of his previous work, in order to convey more confidence in his ability to carry out the proposal successfully. And about the funding, it is possible to have a good understanding of how it will be used, it is a low value compared to the other proposals, but it would also be nice to understand, for example, how long the translation would take to be done to find out the amount of 2k is adequate as a translator's salary. I think that perhaps this professional's hour of work may be more expensive due to the lower number of translators for this language, compared to languages ​​such as Spanish and French (as I said above). Is it the same? Anyway, I think it is possible to understand the process and how the budget is being used in an ok way, but because it is a more different language it would be important to know the translator who would work here. So I won't give it full marks just because I would like these details included.\n",

      "Because it is a relatively simple proposal, auditability is also simple. The author does not detail this part of the proposal very well, he says that the success can be measured based on the popularity of the app in Swali and people of that language buying and delegating Ada. In fact, it is the most direct way for us to understand if the project was successful and achieved what it was looking for. However, other ways can be thought of. For example, it would be very positive if a schedule (however short) was attached to the proposal, so that we could monitor whether the translation process was being carried out properly and within the expected time, for example. It would also be positive if any member of the Swali-speaking Cardano community used the app and brought feedback to the rest of the community, is it working well, is it adequate? Another thing I thought about would be that we understand the impact of this on the Swali-speaking cryptographic community. As I said in this evaluation, I have already seen other proposals focused on this language, whether in a challenge aimed at Africa or for translation, so this portion (Swalí speakers) is very relevant to us in the Cardano community. It would be positive if there was a small satisfaction survey, it could be done directly in the app, which would help us understand what has changed in these people's lives, when it comes to investments and blockchain. And a small 5-question questionnaire in my opinion would be enough, asking things like “have you started to acquire more Ada?” or “have you researched more about Cardano, the activities that can be developed on the blockchain and the difference between our ecosystem and other blockchains/cryptocurrencies?”. That way, a deeper analysis of the impact of the app's translation would be carried out, don't you think? But they are suggestions, because measuring quantitatively is also satisfactory in this case. \n",

      "I found the idea a little poorly explained. They intend to create a Dapp that would serve to ensure that people have access to services and products in a more shared way; from the excerpt “our system provides a dynamic guaranteed income in our community token - $MADAO”, we infer that all users of this application would receive a certain amount of money (in the form of a token of its own for this application), but it is not so clear why this is would be received. Would the user sign up and automatically receive this token? Wouldn't he have to do some service in return, do some kind of work? Proponents claim that the difference between this application and similar ones would be the way to spend the tokens obtained. According to them, in other applications of the genre “there is no practical way to spend your collected tokens on these networks, other than a few handpicked retailers”; the problem would be solved from the moment that “users exchange goods and services directly each other, mediated by our software client, keeping real economic actors and speculators out.” In other words, this application intends to create its own microeconomy. I thought the idea was quite interesting, but two fundamental issues are not so clear. The first is the one I already explained: we don't know if the users of this Dapp would have to provide some product or service in order for them to receive the tokens back; it is not clear if this would be automatically provided, in which case it is a little strange because Dapp would end up playing the role of a social program to support the population, and we do not know where the tokens would be taken from (who would “pay” for this, anyway? simplified way) and also what would be the target audience of Dapp (any specific community, country, location...)? The second question is: how would Cardano technologies be involved here, in a direct way, how would our blockchain benefit? We know it would be a DAO, so we are led to think that the tokens in question would be minted on the Cardano blockchain. In the excerpt “the MADAO network allows users to sponsor each other with contributions of $ADA”, we see that some transactions could be done in Ada, so that's where Cardano's technologies would fit. However, I wish the proponent had clarified this doubt better. I'll give it a neutral grade because I think the idea is good but it's so well explained, so I'm not so sure about the impact. \n",

      "The proposal script starts from the moment the application is ready and users are already using it. We can verify this through the excerpts “MADAO User Client can send and receive MADAO tokens” and “MADAO User Client can distribute dynamic guaranteed income based on Freedom Framework KPIs”, which are activities to be developed in the third quarter of the year. But we are currently in the first quarter (I evaluate this proposal exactly on the 21st of February); when the results of the fund come out and the money is distributed, it will probably happen in May, that is, in the second quarter of 2022. So what will happen in this quarter? Why do proponents explain activities from the third quarter and with Dapp developed? Ideally, the script would be reworked and two changes made. First, the temporal division: it is more appropriate for time to be divided into months rather than quarters. Afterwards, the proponents would have to explain what would happen from the moment the project was financed, that is, mid-May. The activities should be very detailed, we should have a solid understanding of the entire process performed. So, in my view, this script is quite inadequate, it leaves a lot to be desired. Talking about the budget, the explanation of the 17 thousand dollars requested is rather superficial. We know that for example $8,000 will go towards development; however we don't have good explanations about this development, the proponents only claim that the money would be destined to pay the coder, who would create the software. I found this explanation very vague, we would need to know things like 1) what he would do in his work routine 2) for how many months this professional would work 3) how many hours per week would be dedicated to this project (with that, we would know the value of his hour of work and we could find out if he is fair or not). All parts of the budget should be detailed at this level. Finally, analyzing the team, I think that few things are informed about each, we only have an idea of ​​who they are, but we do not know their resumes, previous experiences and connections with Cardano. So there's not a lot of confidence in this team. In summary, I think the project's viability is low and has a lot to improve. \n",

      "The auditability of the process is very good, I would say almost perfect. Four metrics are defined (savings rate + spending rate +\n",
      "network size + engagement) that will serve as a way to measure the development of the project; these metrics directly correspond to the partial results, and I think the explanations about each of them are very well detailed and developed. My only issue here would be to really understand how all this information will reach the members of the Cardano community; there will likely be periodic meetings with IOG representatives, but we don't know how this will be extended to the rest of the community. Therefore, I think it is important that this issue be clarified, other than that, I think everything is in agreement about the auditability of the process. Now talking about the final results, I found that the level of explanation has gone down a lot, the proponents only vaguely outline what would be considered success: “a network of beneficiaries using MADAO to buy goods and services from each other and sharing the ADA to help each other with uncompromising financial demands that cannot be met on MADAO, through an accessible, user-managed dapp.” How can we see in practice if this has been achieved? What measurable metrics will we use to see proven success? How will we know if MADAO network users have also become active members of the Cardano community, in addition to users of this application? Did they go on to acquire more Ada? Are transactions on our blockchain more frequent? I think that the proponents do not establish palpable ways of understanding the desired situation and also do not clarify how the bridge to the Cardano community would be. Anyway, this topic of the proposal isn't bad (especially in the first part, which I thought was really good), but the second part still needs to be explained better, so I'll give it a neutral note. \n",

      "I think the proponent started the description of this project by promising one thing, but I don't know how it would be fulfilled. He says that, many times, players who are not familiar with the cryptographic world and have never bought NFT are scared by it, because they don't know where to go, basically, and that this project would have the differential of being simpler when buying NFT . But why? How is this action easier here than in other games? This is not clear in the course of the proposal. But anyway, analyzing the impact of the game, I think it can be a good idea, in general it's a racing game in which each car is an NFT, and your objective is to defeat bosses until you pass the level (each race would be in a city, in a hypothetical future). According to the proponent, 10,000 car NFTs would be launched later this year and whoever acquired them would have an advantage over those who would start the game from scratch, let's say. I think this could be interesting for Cardano since the cars are CNFTs, that is, NFTs minted on our blockchain, but I would like to know two things: 1) how players would know Cardano differentials from the purchase of these NFTs? How would you realize the advantages of buying/selling active tokens on our blockchain and not on others? 2) is there any other way in the game to benefit our ecosystem? For example, would there be some transactions in smart contracts? Some shopping in Ada? Would players have to link their digital wallets to the game at some point? In general, I like the idea, I think it can work very well because the racing game audience is considerable, it's already a popular style, and if added to the recent NFT boom, this can generate a good adoption of Cardano for new users. But, it is still a little difficult to understand precisely to what extent this game would relate to our blockchain and what advantages it would bring beyond the minting of some NFTs, or if it would be just that. \n",

      "The feasibility of the project is good, but not perfect. In general, we have the basic information we need to understand about the roadmap, budget division and staff, but each of them could be explained more (especially for staff). The script is good, the project is divided into 3 phases, each one being a quarter. The activities carried out in these time intervals are mentioned, however, I think it would be better if the time scale adopted was shorter, for example, monthly. Every 3 months is a very long time to follow the progress of such activities, I would like them to be divided like this, by month, so that the understanding of the process is more solid. The level of detail of these activities is medium, some are more detailed than others, it would be interesting if they all had the same level of detail. The requested budget is quite compatible with the dimension and complexity of the project. In other words, I found it a fair value. It is divided into several small parts, so that we can understand the need for such funding. Each of these parts gets a fairly fair share as well, but what I think could have been done to improve this part was the inclusion of the working hours of the professionals involved. I mean, 4.5k requests in 3d modeling, for example. How long would the designer responsible for this work to achieve the end result? If we had such information, we would know the hourly rate of work required for each small part, which would generate an even stronger understanding of that part. And regarding the team, I think that part was the one that left something to be desired, because we don't know exactly who the team members are. We know which professionals would be involved (such as modeller, 2d pixel artist, etc.), and what their skills are, but that alone doesn't give us so much confidence; we would need to know: their names, examples of work they've done before and how they relate to Cardano. In this way, our knowledge about the team would be fully, and not partially, as it is presented then. Therefore, my suggestions for improving feasibility are: specifying the roadmap in shorter time intervals, explaining all parts of the requested funding equally, and introducing more properly the professionals who will be part of the team. \n",

      "I didn't find the game's auditability very good, it exists but it's not enough, because the ways to monitor its success are very basic (game downloads, website visits and social media engagement), just like the biggest success scenario is plotted abstractly (create an exciting and easy way for players unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies, NFTs and the metaverse to start their journey on the Cardano blockchain). Let's try to delve into this here. Starting with the fact that it's not just the end results that matter. It's important for us as a community to measure all the variables, from the point when the game got off the ground, started its construction, until the moment the final version is delivered and the public starts playing. I believe it is necessary for the team to prepare a summary of the activities carried out each month and make this information available in some way to our community. This can be done through online tools, such as a simple google docs, or something more, such as monthly meetings with some members of the Cardano community, who feel engaged to follow the development of this project more closely. In this way, we would also monitor the process, not just the results. However, it is also important to track whether what was initially intended was achieved, and this could be done by measuring the statistics suggested by the bidder, and putting these research together into perhaps infographics that could be presented again to the rest of us. This is something that would happen towards the end of the project and would perhaps require a single meeting with more participants, so it could be done in some debating room after Town Hall, for example, or if the team prefers they can prepare a full report and send it to them. it to the community on some communication channel, such as Discord or Telegram. It is important that we understand if the final scenario has been reached, that is, create an easier way to deal with NFTs, cryptocurrencies, etc. Therefore, I suggest that there is a small questionnaire in the game itself, which could be made available after some time that players have started playing there, trying to ask if such questions actually happened. So I think the auditability would be deeper. \n",

      "In theory the proposal is excellent, but there are several things to improve. The idea of ​​the proposal is very good and it totally aligns with what is asked in the challenge, because our goal here is to somehow popularize the Cardano ecosystem for the Indian audience, specifically. In this way, we would be contributing to the country's development, since people learning about Cardano could: invest in our currency, which in the long run will generate profit; actively participate in the community, for example through Catalyst; learn more about our technologies and align this with their professional activities (be they in the technology, advertising, legal, business, etc.) That is, in many ways, the local population should benefit. As well as our blockchain, of course, we need to finance ideas that help explain our technologies, through investment in ada, as I mentioned, buying and selling CNFTs, direct investment in some projects like Dapps and etc. All this will certainly be achieved if the Indian population gets to know our blockchain better, and the promotion of these events will certainly help with that. That is, in theory, this idea is perfect with what we are trying to pursue. However, in practice, it is still somewhat abstract how such events would work, little is known about each of them specifically. We know that in total there would be twelve, but we do not know which subjects would be addressed in each meeting; we don't know which professionals would lecture; nor do we know how many people are expected to be an audience for the event, or how the team will be able to publicize the events so that people are interested even without knowing what blockchain is after all. Anyway, little is said about the exact structure of each meeting, we know that there will be an educational demonstration, followed by a lecture and a moment of networking and coffee break, from what I understand. However, what is the difference between the educational session and the lecture? Maybe the target audience, maybe in the first case we are trying to reach young people and students, and in the second case people who are already involved in Cardano's technologies? In other words, my opinion is that the idea is aligned with what is sought in the challenge, but unfortunately the explanations about it are scarce, so it is not possible to fully understand how it will happen, and this compromises our confidence in the impact. Therefore, I will give a neutral grade, if the event had been better explained, the grade would probably be maximum, because the theory itself is exactly what we are looking for in this challenge. \n",

      "A roadmap is not drawn up that allows us to understand well how the necessary processes for carrying out these events would take place. The proponent explains that the events will take place in the 3 main cities, but which cities are these? It is also said that “we would measure our deliveries with a ledger that would track the number of participants throughout the year. Also, how many people can we integrate into our project catalyst through account creation. Another measure we would take is how many people per event create a wallet.” These indicators are interesting to analyze the auditability of the project, however, they do not talk about the feasibility. For the project to be viable, it would be necessary for the proponent to attach a roadmap, indicating the activities that would take place according to a certain time interval (monthly, for example). These activities should talk about the pre-production of these events, everything that would need to be agreed and defined, such as physical space, which speaker would be chosen for each event, how it would be announced to people about the existence of these meetings, etc. That way we would have a solid understanding of the process, which unfortunately does not happen due to the lack of explanations. Regarding the budget, I think it's explained in a very basic way how the requested money would be used. It would cost 1500 dollars per event, 750 for space rental, 500 for the speaker and 250 for meals. But my question is the following, how these prices were defined if a) we don't even know the exact locations of each meeting, so prices can vary b) it is not defined who the speakers are, that is, maybe they charge a value above or under 500 dollars c) the value for meals should be calculated based on how many people will attend each meeting. So I think that although it is quite possible to understand the financial division, it is not so simple to believe in the need for 1500 dollars for each event since everything is still undefined. And finally, speaking of the team, we have a very diverse team here, with many people participating in the project. However, the explanations about each of them are quite superficial. We don't know much about his previous experiences because all that is revealed to us are his professional performances and a small resume is not attached. Some people have made their linkedin profiles available, so it's easier in these cases to check their previous work, what they've done so far, etc., but ideally, all of them would provide this information, not just some team members.

      "The ways to audit the proposal are quite numerical (numbers of: people we can integrate into our project catalyst + people creating portfolios + interactions on social media sites (what media?) + people viewing youtube videos + new proposals coming out from India). In addition to these indicators, in order to carry out an adequate auditability of the process, I think it is important that we monitor the work routine of the professionals involved. What would each of the people mentioned in the team part do for this project? According to the roadmap, which was not actually attached, how can we verify that activities that were promised for each month were actually fulfilled? In summary, what I want to say is: it is important to know quantities, how many people created portfolios, submitted proposals, etc., but it is also necessary for us to know how the whole process of building these events was. Once all this analysis is done, it needs to be made available to the Cardano community. How can we verify this information? Regarding the final result, the proponent again focuses a lot on a quantitative analysis, as according to him success would be measured by the number of people participating and proposals submitted. However, I would like a more humane analysis of the thing, for example: a survey with the participants, to understand how they absorbed the knowledge that was passed on. In what way do they also intend to apply this knowledge, if they will study more about ecosystem technologies, will they participate in Catalyst. If proponents of this project are born, it would be very interesting to know what these proposals were. Finally, we need to know what the real impact of all this was, both for India and for Cardano. Therefore, I think the proponent should promote a broader and richer survey, and this final survey should, as well as the partial results coming from the progress, be available to any member of the Cardano community. There are several ways to establish this bridge, but the most direct, in my view, are through Town Hall, discord groups or telegram. At this point, it is at the discretion of the bidder and his team. To conclude, in summary, what I think is that the path of auditability has started well, but it needs to go beyond the numbers and also become more accessible to all members of the ecosystem. \n",

      "The idea is very interesting, it is a game in which you would have a kind of virtual pet that would actually be a reflection of the player himself. I think a part of the proposal that sums up the project well is the following: “we can collect user data only by completing daily tasks and challenges that are selected by healthcare professionals. The results of completing tasks are scored and added to the Crypt's health. The more the user engages with the game, the more he becomes aware of his state of health, as the Crypt is essentially a representation of himself from the tasks he has completed.” However, I think the general explanation of how the game would work is still pretty sketchy. What would these phases look like? What tasks, for example, would the player have to complete from one stage to the next? What kind of information would be attached? Would this information be recorded on the Cardano blockchain, so would it be visible to everyone? This worries me a little bit, because if it was information about the players' health, they might not feel comfortable making it public. Another point I would like to comment on is that it is not clear how Cardano's technologies would be used here. Proponents claim that the game was all thought to have been architected on web3, however, it is not explained directly how Cardano's blokchain would be used, if the characters would be CNFTs, if there would be payments in Ada and etc. Of course, they provide a whitepaper, but there are 17 pages, it is a little unfeasible for us to read all the content present there. I've read a few things, but it would be far more appropriate for the proponents to make it very clear which Cardano technologies would be used and how they would be built into the game's dynamics. Therefore, my opinion is that the idea is good and innovative, deserving our attention, in fact this is one of the few proposals in the field of games that have to do with the universe of health; however, more detail is needed both on how it would be built, how its gameplay would be, how the phases would be, what the objectives would be and especially how all this would relate to our blockchain. \n",

What exactly would happen in month 1, and 2, and 3? Which professionals would be involved here, doing what small tasks to make the prototyping process possible? What would your work routines be like? In the fifth month, the alpha test would take place. Who would test the game? How would feedback be received, and how would potential changes be implemented? Anyway, I think that the entire game development process is explained in a very superficial way, being necessary that the proponents explain in detail what would need to be done to compose each activity, and it would also be better if they determined monthly instead of a division of longer time. The budget is also explained very thinly, for example $10,000 is asked for Art Styling and Asset Creation. How much would go to Art Syling, and how much to asset creation? It's because? What would the working day of those involved in these tasks be like, for how many days a week would they be working on it, and for how many hours a day? Will the Cardano community have access to the drafts of these phases? How would the assets be created, who would need to do small tasks for this to happen, what justifies this price? 25 thousand dollars are requested for the development of game features, however, it would be necessary for the proponents to explain what this phase is exactly, which small tasks added together would result in this development, which features would be being developed, how long would it take on average for each if one were work and how much would be charged per resource... Anyway, the way the use of the financing is passed on, we cannot understand the need for such a high investment, it would be essential for the authors of the proposal to argue better why each part would cost each amount request. And finally, speaking of the team, it's about two people, I liked this part, I think the curriculum of each one was very well detailed and in which areas they work, but I would like linkedin or some kind of Marco's portfolio Valmora was provided. Through these pages, we can verify the information that was said. In summary, I think the only adequate part of the feasibility is the presentation of the duo, the script and budget being very superficial and in need of a lot of improvement. \n",

      "The proposed ways of auditing progress are quite satisfactory, these are “announcements on a discord server and emails to subscribers” and “regular reports within the catalyst on the progress of the process”. I think these reports should be provided to members of the Cardano community even if there is not the success that was expected, as it is only fair that, if the proposal is funded, we have constant updates on the tasks that were performed and the small goals that were achieved. , at least once a month. Regarding the final scenario, they say that success would be measured if the game prototype was running and being played. This worries me... would the 50 thousand dollars requested be just for building a prototype? So for the final version of the game, would more investment be needed? Talking now about the impact, directly, how can we see if the game was a means of popularizing our blockchain? Would proponents need to devise some way of proving whether Cardano has in fact benefited from this initiative, and if so, how, what changes are notable, how can we see them in practice? They need to do research and point out exactly the consequences of the game for our community, if new active members were added, if the number of transactions on our blockchain increased, if more Adas are being bought and delegated, if new CNFTs were created and traded. ... Anyway, unfortunately I think that about success, everything is still very abstract, it is necessary for the duo of authors to define exact ways in which we could perceive the real impacts of the project on Cardano's blockchain. Therefore, my opinion is that the auditability of the process is excellent, but the final results leave much to be desired, requiring a total reformulation of this specific part. \n",

      "Theoretically, the idea is good and fits the objectives of the challenge, however, the proposal is explained in a very superficial way. Overall, the proponent intends to create a local community center that would serve Philadelphia and surrounding communities to attend conferences on Cardano. From what I understand, the place would be geared towards debate, learning and exchanging experiences in relation to our blockchain. This seems quite relevant given that, according to the proponent “there is an untapped market in the Philadelphia tri-state area of ​​universities with IT departments, technology companies, financial companies and many crypto enthusiasts”. In other words, the field is fertile, there are several people who can potentially become active members of the Cardano community, whether through participation in Catalyst as CA, vCAs; or even by submitting proposals; perhaps these people would buy and delegate Ada, increasing investment in our currency; In short, there are several ways in which this group could be involved in the activities and opportunities of our ecosystem. However, as I said at the beginning of the analysis, the proposal as a whole is very abstract, we know that conferences would take place, but what issues would be addressed exactly? Who would present these lectures? How would the local public be motivated to participate? How often would they happen? It is true that the United States is one of the countries in which blockchain technology already has more strength and is well known, but that does not exclude the need for the proponent to make it very clear how he will captivate the common citizen, who does not know what he is doing. is about blockchain, to participate in these events. Even those who already have some involvement with Cardano: how will they find out about such conferences? For me, the most important thing was to clarify these two things: how people would be notified of these meetings and also what content would be covered exactly at each conference. The proposal aligns with the challenge as we seek here to develop and expand knowledge about Cardano for a specific audience, and I believe that the proponent would be focusing a lot on the local community with this project, but it would also be interesting for him to explain how the specificities of the group in issue would be taken into account when promoting the events. Summing up my opinion, I think the idea makes sense with the challenge in theory, but in practice, it lacks a lot of detail. \n",

      "The feasibility of the project is low. The script is very superficial, we know only superficially what would be done according to the weeks. For example, it would take 5 weeks to do a “Comprehensive Extension and Market Research”. As well? What would a comprehensive extension be? How would market research be done? One month of the project would be dedicated to “Advertising Campaign Design, Event Planning, Infrastructure Setup”. These things are quite different and require a lot of work and effort individually, and it would be necessary for the bidder to explain each of them in detail. For example, advertising campaign design, it would be important to know what strategies would be taken, as design is a very broad area that can involve the realization of illustrations, marketing campaigns on social media, dissemination through posters in cities... From How would this be done, within the various existing possibilities? Regarding event planning, this part encompasses many, many actions. The physical space would have to be chosen, who would present the conferences (who would be the speakers), how the target audience would be approached, what specific content would be the focus of each meeting and so on. All activities cited by the proponent should be further explained. I also think that the way he explains the passage of time is kind of confusing, some activities would happen in parallel, so it would be better if he split the time into weeks, and accurately scored what would be done each week and in what order. Leaving now for the analysis of the budget, the proponent asks for the amount of 27,500 dollars to carry out this project. The explanation of the use of this money is also superficial, the proponent divides the total amount in percentages, allocating how much each part of the project would need. For example in “Infrastructure, Equipment, Labor: 50%” how much would go to infrastructure, how much to equipment and how much to labor? How many people would work on the project and for how many days a week? In this way, we would have an idea of ​​the price of their working hours, if an exact value was assigned to how much money would go towards wages. I think that part of the proposal is totally inappropriate. And finally, about team, no team is presented. We don't know who the people involved were, their professional backgrounds, what previous experiences they had, how they would relate to the Cardano ecosystem... Anyway, nothing is said about it, so no confidence is passed in a team that we don't know. . We only have information about the proponent, but we would need to have information about everyone involved. In general, all parts of this topic need to be rephrased. \n",

      "The auditability of the project is also not good. There are no safe ways to monitor either the process or the final results. Starting with the process, all that the proponent tells us are some things that could serve as indicators for the partial success of the project, I believe, namely: “Impressions, Calls, Clicks, Conversions, Subscriptions and Participants”. But these words are presented quite loosely, we don't know how to clearly correlate them with the development of the project. What I suggest is that, after the proposer reformulates the script, dividing the time into weeks and explaining in more detail the activities that would be developed and each of them, he should make a weekly report and send it to the Cardano community. This report should contain a summary of how everyone's work went that week, whether everyone involved in the project fulfilled their obligations in that time period, whether there were any problems, delays or dissonances, whether the week's goals were achieved, and so on. This report could be written and posted on some online platform, such as Notion or Google Docs. As the weeks went by, the proponent could develop this platform by adding the respective files each week. Regarding the final result, the proponent says that success would be perceived with the holding of the first face-to-face event, with the participation and feedback of the target audience. But I think the final scenario should target all encounters, not just the first one, right? All conferences should be monitored, so that we know if everything went the way it was planned. A survey could also be carried out on how these conferences impacted the local community, if the investment in our blockchain has become a reality, how these advances in relation to Cardano can be perceived, etc. All this can also be posted on the online sharing apps that I have suggested, and in this way, the final scenario of success should be traced. Therefore, I think auditability still has a lot to improve, the way it is presented to us is not possible to have a clear view of how this process could be done. \n",

      "The proposal in theory is fantastic and meets the objectives of the challenge very well, but I believe it is a little ambitious. I will explain. The idea is to gather all the data that involves Catalyst, whether the proposals, voting portfolios, from what I understand I would also include how the financial part of each proposal would be developing in practice, the dates (schedule) of the funds and etc. This would be useful both for what the challenge is looking for, ie improving auditability, verifying how the funds requested in each proposal are being used, if each funded project is being done as promised, etc.; as for the previous part, that is, it would also help the members of the Cardano community to situate themselves in time and space. One of the challenges of working as a CA, vCA and I believe even as a proposer (I can't say, because I've never submitted any proposal) is knowing when things will happen. When will our work time begin, changes in the Catalyst schedule and that, it is certain that we can have this information in Town Hall and also through any of the various means of communication in the community (Telegram and Discord, for example). However, if a platform were created that was able to transmit this information in a clear and secure way, it would be much better for everyone. It would be better both for our pre-funding work and for us to be able to track the winners of each round. What worries me is the complexity of this project, its breadth. There is a LOT of information pertaining to Catalyst. How do the authors plan to be able to access and organize them? I'm also worried about the part where they say that maybe this couldn't be done in time, before such information becomes private (as I understand it, that's it), which would generate the need for new funding. In theory, it's a proposal that would make the day-to-day life of Cardano community members so much easier that it would become revolutionary, but in practice, this is very difficult to do. Therefore, I would have more confidence in the impact if the bidder explained better how they were going to carry out this data gathering; collect information, organize it, etc. In other words: if there was more certainty that the project would work and the funding would be well used, that the results would align with what we asked for in the challenge in practice. I would have this peace of mind if he detailed, explained the process of building the ₳GOV platform. Therefore, I will give three stars. It's a great idea, but it would need to be more detailed in order to convey safety on impact. \n",

      "I liked the feasibility of the project, having some parts that were adequate and others that could be improved. We know what was going to happen in a very detailed way: in the part of the roadmap, the proponent divides the time into months and within those, into weeks, stating which activities would be developed in each of them. This is very positive, so we have a very clear view of the process. What I said about the impact, that is, the insecurity of how all this data would be collected and organized, is still present here. For example, the bidder states that he will spend 1 week to collect data concerning the treasury and wallet. But is this time enough to perform such a long task? In addition to this uncertainty, as I said, the level of detail in the script is quite satisfactory and is adequately explained. Regarding the budget, we also have a great level of detail. We know how the total amount of 35k would be divided between the parties, for example, how much would go towards each participant's salary (including the value of their working hours). What left me with a doubt here was the following: How long would this project last? In the part of the division of months, the proponent mentions a continuity from month 4 onwards, but until which month, exactly? Month 5, 6? We know how many hours each professional would work in total, but not how long the project would last, so we don't know how long they would work per month. I would like this issue of total time to be clarified to improve general understanding. Some parts of the budget could also be better explained, for example 5k for panel/software licenses, but why is this amount necessary? How many licenses would there be, and what would each of them be for? This specific part of the budget still left me in doubt. And finally in relation to the team, I thought that part left something to be desired. What is a \"PM\"? About Ro Mathew, I would like more details about him. We know his basic function and in a very summarized way some of his professional experience, but a deeper level of detail would be needed. The explanation of his resume could be longer, we should know in more detail what his previous jobs were, how he got involved with the Cardano ecosystem, what his connection to our blockchain is, etc., in addition to his linkedin profile, if any. The proponent states that he will also hire a free lancer, but it would be important that he already had someone in mind to convey more confidence in his preparation for this job. \n",

      "The auditability of this proposal was insufficient, in my view. What the proponent claims is that everyone will be able to enter the site being created without their data being collected (the famous cookies). This is one of the ways that the community could follow the progress of the project, but in my opinion it is also the duty of the team to provide us with some information about the partial results of the project. For example, the team could prepare a monthly progress report and make it available to the Cardano community, because this would make monitoring the proposal more direct and summarized than people logging into the platform alone. That way it would be possible to audit in a more unique way too, because everyone would receive the same information, and as the proponent himself says at the beginning of his proposal, Catalyst has so many proposals, so much data and things happening that if we community members keep analyzing the proposals in such an individual way, it would not be so simple to carry out a constant follow-up. In my view, it is more appropriate for the team itself to take sides on this issue, providing the community with simple means of monitoring whether the phases are being fulfilled as promised. In relation to the development of the phases, in addition to the final product (how many is the site built), this part is better contemplated, in my opinion, since the proponent establishes a roadmap with a good level of detail, clarifying what would be done as the weeks go by. We have enough material to verify the progressive progress of the project, it is enough for a member of the community, perhaps someone responsible for auditing proposals for this challenge, to establish direct and periodic contact with the project team. So, in summary my perception of project auditability is: it is satisfactory in terms of tracking progress, but not the partial results of the project. \n",

      "The idea is very good but I'm not sure it's innovative enough for this challenge. Here we want to fund projects that aim to bring content from the Cardano ecosystem to traditional media and new audiences, to pierce the bubble that already exists in social networks (telegram, discord) and youtube, where we already have a good amount of media content related to Cardano and a lot of spectators. The idea of ​​this proposal is to create a website that would bring together several things, in the proposer’s own words, “a YouTube-style video-based website that has video and information channels, a forum, a Help Desk/FAQ/Knowledge Base crowd-based and a future online store selling products.” The project's differential is that all the information that circulated here had to be proven, so that there were only facts and not opinions. For me, this was the most positive part of the project, and also some moderation strategies such as the fact that you have to pay a monthly fee to comment on the forum, thus avoiding those comments that don't add up and bring false information. However, what I said at the beginning about not being sure if it meets the specific objectives of the challenge well is because spaces would be created here to do things that already exist, we already have several youtube channels that talk about Cardano, including official and extremely reliable channels like the IOHK channel, for example. I don't see much need for us to create a new website to post videos about our blockchain if we already have such a strong community on youtube. The part of the store, which will sell NFT in the future, was a little abstract, what would be sold once it opened? Who would get the money? The forum and FAQ part seems to me the most interesting, in my opinion if the site focused on this it would be a more valid proposal, because in more than 1 year as an active person in the Cardano community, with CA at 4 funds, I have never heard of of some site that was a heavily monitored forum and FAQ. I think the debates/questions and answers take place on the community's own communication channels, such as telegram and discord, but I don't know if there is a space dedicated solely to this and that is well organized. Therefore, I partially agree that this proposal has a positive impact and aligns with the objectives of the challenge, as I explained, here it is intended to develop things that already exist and are well consolidated, while a certain part of the idea is indeed innovative and seems to me to be very useful for Cardano. \n",

      "The proposal does not have a roadmap per se. What we find here is an explanation (quite extensive) of what would need to be done, what activities would be developed so that together they could compose the project as a whole. However, this is not in the form of a timeline, there is no phase division or notion of time here. It would be necessary for the proponent to divide this explanation into smaller parts, according to the phases of the project, and they would need to be associated with some notion of time: phase 1 would last 4 months, for example, and would take place between June and September 2022. Ideally, these phases would consist of a list of tasks and each task should also be located in a specific month and informed how long it would take to complete. Therefore, I disagree that there is a good visualization of the process here. It is explained what would be done, but not in an organized way and associated with the passage of time. Regarding the budget division, I think this explanation is much clearer, I can understand why 48k was requested and how this money would be divided into parts. I think that in relation to the salary of the professionals involved, there could be one more explanation, since it corresponds to almost half of the entire budget. It would be important for us to know how many hours per week they would work, that way we would know the price of their working hours and we could analyze if it is compatible with the market or above. It is very interesting that they included the potential income of the project, this is something that I do not usually see in the proposals and it serves to have a visualization of how this money (48k) could generate return, reinforcing the idea that it is an investment and not a spent. And finally, about the team members, we only have information about the bidder, which worries me. As I understand it, he intends to hire other professionals to compose a team, but in this case, would he still select them? I would like more clarity on this matter. However, speaking of him, there is a very rich and extensive detail about who he is, previous experiences and also his linkedin profile, through which we can see his work in practice. However, I am also concerned that he did not clarify his relationship with our blockchain, how he understands Cardano, his experiences in the ecosystem, etc. For me, it is essential to always have at least one person on the team who is highly knowledgeable about our blockchain technologies, and this is not clear.

The measurement of progress he suggests is abstract, “meet the milestones to be set for website development and launch”, what are these milestones? It would be necessary that gradual objectives were outlined, so that the community would be able to progressively follow the progress of things. I think that with the creation of a detailed schedule this would be more possible, the proponent could prepare reports at the end of each month with information on the main advances, in a language accessible to all and forward it to the Cardano community through one of our communication channels, as I mentioned earlier in my review. Another alternative would be for a member of the community, who understands well the technologies involved in this project, to be able to follow the development of the stages directly with the proponent, and bring this feedback to the rest of the community. Regarding the results, the way in which the proponent suggests measuring success is very comprehensive, it would be necessary to establish more specific goals, such as the number of posts that move the forum, views of the videos attached to the site, etc. In this way, we would have more solid ways of monitoring, even numerically, the possible success of the project. I suggest that the proposer, who proves to be extremely capable and qualified even for the elaboration of such a technical proposal, revise this final part of it, in order to bring more details that can improve the quality of auditability by the Cardano community. \n",

      "The proposal is very well summarized by the excerpts “our project aims to create a flow of truly sustainable fashion, starting from Gabon, where global warming is progressing, and using organic indigo dyes derived from plants that grow only in the tropics” and “our mission is to combine organic indigo dyes from the majestic land of Gabon with traceable blockchain technology.” That is, the idea of ​​the proponents is to combat unsustainable fashion by growing a plant called Indigo, which will be cultivated in Gabon, an African country. After the plant’s cultivation process was complete, they would extract the blue dye and dye clothes, and all the information about that piece, such as “origin of the fashion product, such as production areas, raw materials and date on which the fashion items have been dyed” will be minted on the Cardano blockchain. The proponents also explain that each time the same piece is dyed, a new NFT will be generated. The idea is, in short, to produce clothes and fashion accessories in a more conscious way, proponents argue that the heart of the matter is to fight the pollution generated by the traditional fashion industry, where most of the dyes that dye the clothes are from petroleum derivatives; and we all know how bad this process is for the environment. As interesting as the idea is in theory, I disagree that it's a high-value proposition for Cardano, and I also don't think it fits well with the goals of this challenge. Let's go: first, I don't think people will be so curious about information as specific as where the plant that gave rise to the color of your clothes was grown; this seems to be an interest of a more select public, people who like fashion and sustainability. It doesn't really seem like a common curiosity among the general public. So I don't think there will be as much engagement around the NFTs that will be generated. Secondly, the proponents themselves claim that they still do not have an exact development plan for the software that will produce this technology, they admit that the greatest difficulty of the proposal will be to integrate the fashion world, the color extraction process and the Cardano blockchain. During the team's description (I won't go into this now, but just to make my point), we see that only Osamu Takahashi is involved with blockchain, but apparently he's not that knowledgeable about Cardano in particular. For these reasons I am unsure how much this project will impact our blockchain, since even the integration is uncertain. Now talking about the specific objectives of the challenge, in this challenge our purpose is to fund Dapps that benefit a specific country/community. Gabon is mentioned here, but it is not clear whether its inhabitants would contribute to this project and how they would benefit. It seems to me something that would generate benefits mostly for the specific team, but not for the local population. So unfortunately I think the impact here is low. \n",

      "Unfortunately, the viability of the project is low. Let's look at each of the main parts individually. Starting with the script, the activities to be developed are not described in detail, nor do we have a temporal notion of how long each phase of the process would take. Proponents report that it is difficult to predict the exact time of harvest, I agree, we have no way of controlling nature, but they could have given an idea of ​​how long it would take for other tasks (team work) to be done. For example, “dyeing the fabric, etc. using the extracted pigment”; Could the bidders have said how long this would last, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months? Who would work on it? It would be really cool if we knew how this process would be done, what pieces of clothing they intend to dye and etc. In other words, the script is too superficial, we have no way of understanding how long this would all take in practice. Regarding the budget, I also found this part explained in an inadequate way, very superficial, asking for 50 thousand dollars, a very high amount; and the explanation of the parts is very basic, lacking in detail. For example, “Prototyping Product: 20,000 USD”. Why would this process cost $20,000? Who would work here? What would you do, how is the creation of a prototype in practice? Even, from the way it is said, we thought that only one model of clothing or accessory would be dyed, but on impact I had understood that there would be several. I think that the financial explanations are not enough to have an accurate view of how the money would be spent, we don't know, for example, the exact salaries of the professionals involved, nor how much time would be dedicated to the project (how many hours per month, for example) . Thus, we do not have a good idea of ​​whether the asking price is fair or not. Finally, speaking of the team, I also think that the explanations provided about the 3 team members are basic. We don't know examples of their previous work, all we are told is in which professional area each one works. It is also unclear whether the blockchain enthusiast has any specific knowledge about Cardano, as I said at impact. Therefore, trust is not conveyed in the team, it would be important to have examples of what they have done before (for example, a portfolio with the articles dyed by the indigo specialist, examples of projects that the blockchain enthusiast has already been involved in, etc). \n",

      "The auditability of the process is very low, the proponents claim that “every detail of this manufacturing process will be recorded”, so that the information that will be minted on the Cardano blockchain can be gathered in the future. Okay, but where exactly would these records be made? Will they use some data sharing application, such as google docs? How would the Cardano community have access to such information? In addition to data on the cultivation, extraction, dyeing and finishing of fashion products, how will the tasks behind it be monitored? That is, how would we be aware of the work routine of those involved, how would we know if the plans, whether monthly, weekly, etc., were being duly obeyed or if there was a problem? In the way it is explained to us, auditability is still very abstract, remaining in a very theoretical field. Now, for the final results, bidders also very imprecisely state how this auditability would be done. They reinforce the success scenario, said since the impact, being “the essence of future fashion that we envision is an unprecedented sustainable fashion, with unalterable information about the origin of things, such as raw materials and manufacturing processes”. But how can we perceive the impacts of this, in a measurable way? How can we understand if fashion has become more sustainable, even if on a local scale (Gabon)? The profits generated from the dyed accessories, which will be handmade so I imagine they will be a little more expensive than items sold in fast fashion, where would that money go? How exactly can we measure the return of this project to Cardano? Also, targeting the specific objectives of the challenge, how would this project help the local population of Gabon? How will all this data become accessible to the Cardano community? Unfortunately, I think that everything that is said is very much in the theoretical field, we do not know exactly how this project can be audited, lacking objective data to be achieved, methodologies on how they could be analyzed and form practices through which our community would have knowledge about everything. \n",

      "The proposal meets the requirements of the challenge very well, because it will translate into Chinese articles that explain Plutus, Cardano, Haskell and SPOs, as I understand it. These are already existing articles in English, and the proponent intends to make such content accessible to Chinese speakers. I think this is the kind of thing that we are really looking for in the challenge, we want to encourage the use of our blockchain in East Asia, benefiting its residents and also making Cardano popular there, and by providing some guides on how to understand the languages computational tools used by us and how the pools work (how to acquire Ada and delegate them), we are certainly encouraging China's residents to enter the Cardano ecosystem, fully benefiting the country. This could generate employment, if those people who have contact with the articles are already in the technology area, there is no shortage of developer vacancies for Cardano's various projects, I believe that in relation to the number of vacancies, the workforce is still scarce, so it's a good idea to educate people in strategic places, like China. The benefits for its population are undeniable. The proponent also says that he will contact Start ups that have blockchain transactions to consider using Cardano, I didn't feel very confident about how this could be done (needed a more detailed explanation here, I think), but if that possible, it will be an exponential gain for our community.

What country is he from? How did you learn Chinese? Is it your mother tongue? Do we have some examples of your previous work, to prove what is said? We would also need to understand what kind of connection it has with the Cardano ecosystem: whether it develops within our blockchain technologies or not, whether it invests in Ada, how this person establishes a bridge with the rest of the community, and so on. In my opinion, it would be more appropriate if he hired a professional translator or at least provided some proof that he is prepared to do this job. The author does not provide a very detailed roadmap, it is said that translated articles will be delivered approximately every 2 days, and the amount of articles he expects to deliver in the month. But how many months would this work take? It's not possible to calculate your salary as we don't know if it would last 2, 3 or 4 months, I don't know. I would like to better understand the process of how he would get in touch with start ups too, how would he get a space between them? How would it pique your interest in Cardano? And as for funding, it's entirely about his salary, that is, how much he'll earn to translate the articles and contact these companies. But as I said, without knowing the amount of content to be translated, there is also no way to understand the value of working hours. Therefore, I believe that the author could review this part of his proposal, work in more detail, in order to increase confidence in the feasibility of the project. \n",

      "This part of the proposal also left something to be desired, unfortunately. The proponent cites a very vague way for us to understand if his proposal was successful, which would be for Chinese speakers to understand how Cardano works, how to develop projects on the blockchain and expand our ecosystem. That is indeed what success would be, but in a very abstract perspective. It would be necessary for us to understand these goals on a smaller scale, for example, how many people does he intend to reach per month? How could we find out if those involved with these articles are actually learning about our blockchain and putting it into practice? I think it would be necessary to establish a notion that is both numerical (expectation of people to be reached in a certain amount of time) and qualitative (how, in fact, reading these articles has interfered with your way of seeing blockchain and if they are actively participating in our community ). It would also be necessary to monitor the translation process, that is, if the proponent would in fact be delivering a translated article every 2 days, as he promises. In addition, it would be important for a Chinese speaker in the ecosystem to be able to verify that the articles are translated correctly and adequately. So yes, we could audit the proposal with more specificity. Therefore, my conclusion is: no, based on the information given during the proposal, it is not satisfactorily auditable. \n",

      "I think the proposal aligns well with the objectives of the challenge, although the matches themselves could be better explained. Our goal in the present challenge is to fund games that help popularize Cardano and its technologies to the gaming public, games that make more people know and understand the advantages of our blockchain. This game involves several Cardano technologies: it would be a “play to win” style game, where players would participate in rounds (tournaments), in which: to enter the game, they would need to pay a small fee; if they win, they will be rewarded in Ada or NFTs minted on our blockchain; players would be free to choose the characteristics of their matches, such as the number of players at a time, the minimum level of each to participate, whether players would have to broadcast their games, and so on. From what I understand all rewards and payment of fees would be done through smart contracts on Cardano. In other words, the game addresses technologies relevant to our blockchain at various points, as I said, and this makes those who play enter the community kind of unconsciously. In case the people that the game is profitable and it becomes popular, new members would be attracted to Cardano in an organic way. What I think was pending here was to explain the exact functioning of these games. Would it be a poster game? How would players compete? It would be interesting for the proponent to explain to us in detail how this gameplay would be in practice, even to understand if it is a more accessible game or more geared towards those who already have the habit and ability to play. Therefore, I think the proposal is good, but to be 100%, more explanations would be necessary. \n",

      "The viability of the project is not very good, unfortunately. Starting with the script, we don't have a schedule per se, we don't know which phases would make up a whole and how long each one would take. What we have is a list of activities to be developed, but this is not a roadmap, this is really information about how the process is divided into actions, but do you understand that to be a roadmap such actions would need to be organized in a timeline? The bidder says that the requested funding would last 12 to 24 months, but let's use the 1 year example to make it easier. In 1 year, how would these activities split up? In the first month, what would happen? And in the second? It would also be necessary for the proponent to attach a brief explanation of each of the tasks, so that we can better understand each one and how it would work. We need to understand if some depend on others, and how this relationship takes place, that is, some could only start to be done after the completion of previous tasks and so on. The establishment of deadlines would also help us to audit the proposal, as I will comment on the topic below. Regarding the budget, very high funding is requested, 167k USD, and I don't think it's argued well because it would take so much. The bidder divides this amount into smaller parts, which is correct, but would it be necessary to detail why, for example, just the smart contracts + wallet integration part would cost 96k alone? Who would work on it, what would their work routine be like, how many hours would this job be done, and how long would it take to complete? As in this example, the other parts could be better explained, such as the marketing part. Despite being one of the cheapest (5k), I would still like to understand who would work here, doing what and for how long... Regarding the team, finally, we don't have an individual detail of who would be the team's professionals . We know the type of professional involved: developers, manager, designer... But who are these people? What are their names, what have they done so far in their careers, how do they relate to the Cardano ecosystem? Without knowing each one of them in depth, trust is not transmitted in the team. Therefore, I think the feasibility of the project still has a lot to improve. \n",

      "In my view, the proponent lists good indicators to measure the success of their project, such as the number of CNFTs minted on the platform, number of active members versus players, value earned by players, etc. Success would be a new blockchain gaming platform that manages at the same time to expand, benefit its players through the possible profit generated and popularize the Cardano ecosystem in the meantime. I believe these are really the necessary monitoring statistics, but how are we going to audit this? Regarding the results, the proponent should monitor such data and after that, take them to the knowledge of the Cardano community. This could be done through the preparation of monthly reports or even by the participation of the proponent and his team in some room after Town Hall, in order to explain what final results the game has been achieving. Now about the process, the proponent does not outline any form of auditing, I think this part is really difficult to follow since we don't have any exact timeline for the development of the project. As I suggested earlier in feasibility, it is necessary for the proponent to establish dates, deadlines and a maximum time for each thing to be done, in this way we would have an idea if the construction of the whole is going as desired. This would also need to be brought to the community constantly, as it is a game, and games are almost always complex projects, I suggest that some members of the Cardano community closely monitor the progress of this process and gather the main updates, taking them to the rest of the community members. This could also be done on a monthly basis, I think it's not too big and not too short a time interval for us to audit the progress of the proposal. With that, I conclude that: the proponent places us well on the auditability, of the final results, but not on the process of building the game. \n",

      "The idea aligns well with the objectives of the challenge, as it intends to create a token that would be used to track the expenses of funded proposals. The problem here is that the explanation on how this Dapp would work is quite insufficient, we don't know exactly how this technology would work. Indeed, the issue of how winning teams manage the funding they receive is a real one, and I believe it is one of the most important things to be audited by the Cardano community. If the proposer had explained in detail how this technology would work, in a way that was accessible to others (ie, in not-so-technical language), I would certainly have given full marks to the impact of this proposal. However, unfortunately, the way the idea is explained, we couldn't see how this Dapp would fulfill the objective of auditing the teams' financial expenses. The excerpt “Wallets linked to the token are not used for expenses. That means we would have to have a catalyst requirement to use the wallet that owns the token” is quite confusing, I really didn't understand what the proposer meant by that. So I think the idea is good in theory, but we don't have a solid understanding of how the application would work so we can't trust its impact. I suggest the proponent stick to their idea (the design intent is great) and fill the proposal with details, explanations, and examples of how this Dapp would work in practice. Therefore, I will give it 2 stars, I think it is not valid for an idea to be presented (as much as it is very consistent with the objectives of the challenge) but not adequately explained. \n",

      "The proposal roadmap is not adequate because the proposer only informs what would have to be done, but does not detail how and also tells us when. He would need to determine how long each of these activities would take, for example: “Win ​​the tokens, decide what properties they have (single fungible token for each round of catalyst)”. This is work for how long, 3 weeks, 2 months? It is difficult to visualize the project development process, especially if we are not from the technological professional environment. The minimum that should be done here is a division into months, that is, in which months the activities mentioned would be carried out. That way, we would have a much better understanding of what was about to happen. The ideal would be for the proponent to explain more details about the activity, to have divided the time period into months (and they into weeks) and also to indicate who would be responsible for each thing. About funding, I thought this part was much better than the script, as we know how the total amount would be divided into “small” parts (actually, the asking amount is quite high). The money would basically be used to pay the salaries of the professionals involved, and we also know how many hours per month each one would work, that is, about this part, we understand what is being said very specifically. Now, speaking of the team, this part is not described the way it should, because we have little information about those involved, so we cannot know them so well and so we cannot develop as much confidence in relation to the team's preparation to execute the proposal. All that is said are the names and professional functions of each member, the experiences are presented very briefly, it would be necessary for a more elaborate curriculum to be informed as well. Also, it is always critical, in my opinion, that linkedin profiles, or github, or portfolios (in the case of those who work with design) are provided; in other words, some way of verifying the information that was said.

What would “scrum” be in “Weekly SCRUM Meetings (Agile Practices, CI/CD)”? I believe the proponent has tried to explain in parentheses, however it still remains inaccessible to me. What purpose would these meetings have? Who would be meeting? The whole team, or just a few participants? The proponent claims that it would be possible to “Track the expenses of our own project in a public and transparent way”, however, what form is this? How does he intend to make this information accessible to everyone? I think it would be very important to clarify this, mainly because the proposal addresses exactly this factor (budget auditability). Speaking of the bottom line, the goal cited by the proponent of “Having a dashboard that tracks spend/motives for each Catalyst project in one place” is basically a repeat of what is said in impact. He doesn't outline a scenario of success, what he does is restate what would be done here. It is necessary that the author of the proposal and his team study ways to safely perceive the consequences of this project for the Cardano community. Has auditability really benefited? And if so, how can we prove it? How will this information reach the members of our ecosystem? Unfortunately, I don't think there are any objective and valid ways to monitor this project, and this part needs a good improvement. \n",

      "I disagree that this proposal is interesting for Cardano and fits the objectives of this challenge. Here, we are looking to fund projects that allow our blockchain to handle all aspects of the self-sovereign identity ecosystem, as exactly described in the explanations of this challenge. This can be achieved by an improvement in the share and growth of adoption, portability, usability, accessibility, etc. of Atala Prism DIDs. In short, we want to make this technology more popular and we want our blockchain to stand out in the SSI universe. However, this proposal in no way brings up Cardano specifically, it is much more about a different way of looking at the concept of identity. It is not explained at any time how the target audience (in this case, I conclude that they are the inhabitants of Cameroon, since the project will be promoted by the Wada group from Cameroon, in Africa) would be encouraged to adopt the Atala Prism DIDs; how they would become accessible to all, considering the social, economic and cultural differences of the community in question. The specific objectives of the challenge are not really addressed in this idea. In summary, what the proponents claim is that a series of debates would be promoted on the concept of “being”, of “I”, of self-identity. But it seems to me to be something quite philosophical, as for example when they say that we are traditionally led to present ourselves for our professional functions (for example, such a person is a professor, an engineer and so on) and not really because of a rich set of things that they range from our ancestry, to the experiences we go through and to all the concepts that surround us. It's an interesting and necessary reflection indeed, but I don't think it's to Cardano's advantage to fund this debate as it's not made clear at any point how this would all promote greater adoption of DIDs, how this technology would break the bubble. of those who already know blockchain, know Cardano and know what a DID is and want to get it. It is also said that a game would be made from the information discussed, but it is not very clear what this game would be like or its gameplay. For the project to have an impact, it would be necessary for this issue to be very well secured, unfortunately the impact seems to me to be very low, if the proponents had aligned all this philosophical debate with a greater adhesion of Cardano's self-sovereign identities, I would say that the proposal it would make much more sense for this challenge and for Catalyst as a whole, as it would contribute to the dissemination of our blockchain technologies. \n",

      "The script does not contain a date, we do not know how long each of the phases would take to complete. In fact, the first two phases boil down to promoting debates and reflections, as we can see from the excerpts “Phase 1 will focus on closing conversations/contracts that we started with experts in the subject to invite them to some of our debates” and “Phase 2 will consist of leveraging the space of the African City Hall to bring the community into debates and in-depth discussions around the notion of Identity seen through the lens of the African paradigm”. Both could be better detailed. For example in the first phase, who are the experts they refer to? Are they teachers, sociologists, philosophers, specialists in African culture and history? How will your speeches contribute to these reflections and how would all this benefit the Cardano ecosystem? In the second phase, it is said that the population would be invited to participate in such debates; but how will they be captivated to it? How will they leave their comfort zones, their traditional notions of identity and come to have this more holistic view of the subject? And how will these reflections make them adopt the Atala Prism DIDs or get to know what Cardano is, what are the characteristics and differentials of our ecosystem? It would also be important for us to know some more practical aspects of the project, such as how long each debate meeting would last, how often they would take place and where they would take place (would it be an online meeting or a face-to-face meeting?). Regarding the budget, 30 thousand dollars are requested, explanations of how the total amount would be divided are present but very superficial. We know, for example, that 6 thousand dollars would be paid for \"consultation fees for specialists in the subject\". How do you mean? How many fees would be paid, how many specialists? And how would they contribute to this project? ”, USD 3,000 is requested, but at no point in the description of the proposal is it explained what these trips would be, from where to where, who would do what, etc. That is, it is also not possible to understand this expense. In my opinion, all parts should be better detailed, so that we had an idea of ​​the need for 30 thousand dollars for this project. Finally, when it comes to the team, in general, good information is provided about the participants of the project (except in the case of from Nlongi Nswadi Ki-Mbazi, it is only said that he is an expert in this subject of non-traditional identity, probably, but we know nothing about his professional training or previous work, nor how his profile from the link edin or another site that serves as a portfolio). As for the others, we have this knowledge, we know their areas of professional activity, some characteristics of their journeys (for example, in the case of programmers, we know which languages ​​they work with); your linkedin profiles are also said. The only thing that remained pending was that they better establish who would do what in the project.

      "The auditability of this proposal is an exact copy of the challenge description. Note: in relation to measuring progress, proponents copy and paste the written part “Some directions that projects can take are: Participation and adoption growth, Portability, Usability and accessibility, Governance frameworks (...)”. We can find this same excerpt with these same words on the ideascale page that talks about this specific challenge. These metrics have nothing to do with this proposal. It would be correct for the proponents to adapt what is said in the description of the challenge to the characteristics of the project. It would be important to outline ways to monitor 1) the work routine of all professionals involved. In this case, we don't know what they would be like, we don't know who would do what, when and for what purpose, so we don't have any material on which to base this monitoring 2) the partial results obtained, that is, the small achievements, the goals set for each phase - we also do not have this information set out, so again it is not possible to exercise the auditability of these processes 3) if the stages would be happening in the planned time, that is, if the desired duration was actually what happened. In the final results/success scenario part, the proponents again copy and paste sentences from the challenge description: “What does success look like? Receiving high quality projects; growing participation on SSI discussions; partnering with ecosystem, governance and working groups / Key Metrics to measure: The number of proposals that directly address SSI in a quantifiable manner”. They do not outline a scenario of success directed to the particularities of this proposal, we do not know which final goals are aimed or measurable ways of perceiving them. It would be necessary for the proponents to make it very clear how this project would contribute to the proposed reflection on the reformulation of the notion of identity; and mainly how this would contribute to Cardano becoming a prominent blockchain in the SSI world, how Atala Prism would be widely adopted by the community involved here and how, consequently, our blockchain would become popular and receive investments from it. So I think that unfortunately the auditability here is null, the proponents don't indicate any information on how we could monitor both the development and the final results of this project; they just copy what is already done in the explanation of this challenge. \n",

That said, this proposal totally fits the challenge, South Korea is in the geographic region that we are looking to invest in this challenge. The proposal is about translating an existing application into Korean, which according to the author has a 4.5 rating on the play store, which helps its users to buy ada and delegate it to some pool. If this application is translated into Korean it will certainly be a substantial gain for us, because it will help to spread our technologies in a country that already has a good base for cryptography and in my view it is a key market. It would be interesting for the application to dialogue with all audiences, that is, to be understandable not only by those who already understand what blockchain, cryptocurrencies, etc., but also for laypeople. A short guide explaining the main concepts of the cryptographic world could be included in the application itself. Furthermore, yes, it is a proposal that perfectly aligns with the specific objectives of the challenge, in which we aim to invest in East Asia in order to increase the number of holders of Ada, transactions on the blockchain, NFT and future members of the Cardano community. And all this will be possible if we are able to establish a bridge between our technologies and the local population, and there is no better way to do this than producing content in the native language. \n",

Although the author already has experience in what he intends to do, as he says he already has 10 years of experience with mobile application development, and also has millions of downloads, I would like to see some examples of his work. It could be some applications that he has already developed, so we would get to know his practical experience. In addition, it is always important to know the relationship of the proponents with the Cardano ecosystem. How did they discover our blockchain, besides this app, does the author have any projects at Cardano? In addition to being a developer, does he have other occupations, what was your academic background? In the same way, in my opinion, it is necessary for us to know who the translator would be, for us to know a little about his/her curriculum, what other translation jobs he/she has developed so far, if this person understands anything about cryptocurrencies, etc. Ideally, the proposer would already arrive with his candidate for translator, but if this is not possible, he could even tell us how he intends to select this person. The proposal development process is not very detailed, we know that two parallel activities would take place here, the developer part and the translator part. Would one happen before the other, or at the same time? How long would each part take to work, in which month would these works start and what is their expected completion date? In the same way, the budget division is informed in a basic way, if we do not know how long the work of the two professionals would take, we cannot calculate the relationship between time and price, and thus it is a little difficult to assess whether the requested amount is fair. I also don't know how the author would go about spreading this translation, how would people in South Korea be aware of this app?

This is the essential thing to know, but we can also go further, seeking to know a little more about the impact of this proposal on their lives. As with the author's other proposals to translate his app, I think it would be necessary to establish some research here. Could a survey be carried out to understand if the target audience would be getting involved with the Cardano community in addition to this initiative, that is, would they be participating in Catalyst? Have they become CAs, vCas or even bidders? Are they betting more on our blockchain than others? Have there been significant changes in Korean investment in Cardano? As I say at the beginning of the evaluation, in terms of impact, it would be nice to understand if the focus was more directed to our blockchain with the help of this app, because South Korea is a great power, which already has a significant portion of investments in the cryptographic world, but as with most places, the most famous coins take up almost all the space, we need to invest in ways to strengthen Ada. Has this proposal contributed in this sense, based on the experience of its users?

      "I believe that we have two key prepositions in the impact of this proposal. The first one is about what will actually be developed in this project: a greater clarification about what web3 and metaverse; according to the proponents, there are many honest and dedicated people who can make this technological revolution a reality and also long-term adoption. But there are also those who try to take advantage of the initial boom to profit quickly and easily from the uninformed; with this, the objective of this proposal would be precisely to provide an exact and safe definition of what these things are (web3 and metaverse), what are their daily applications and how we can advantageously relate to them. They claim they will answer questions like “What is WEB 3.0? What is the Metaverse?”, in order to more solidly clarify this new technological front that is now starting to be implemented. This proposal was launched in the gaming challenge because, according to the proponents, “The gaming industry will be the first to claim the implementation of WEB 3.0 and Metaverse approaches”. I wish they had explained this vision better, because for people who aren't gamers or as tech-savvy, it's understandable at a basic level why the gaming business would adopt these technologies, but it's not so clearly understandable as a whole. Why the games industry? How would web3 relate to this? How can Cardano overlap, compared to other blockchains, in this emerging context? In general, I think the scope of the proposal is great, we know what will be done and why it will be done - the authors argue very well the need for this initiative. They also detail who they are, what the DLT360 group promotes, a kind of consultancy for companies or groups within our community on the advantages and characteristics of working with blockchain; from what I could understand, they are people who are well involved with the technologies of the Cardano ecosystem and who already work clarifying what blockchain is, so I think that if we have a qualified group to explain the concepts of web3 and metaverse, this is it. They have already demonstrated service through the projects already developed, as we can see from the website attached in the “Website/GitHub repository (if relevant)” part.

This happens because they have several projects being developed at the same time, and some of them go through the same processes/steps, from what I understand. They then explain to us what these generic and specific processes would be. Starting from topic 6, they detail what would then be the tasks specifically geared towards this project, in “participation in the 2-week meetings of the DLT360 Technology Team, active efforts to integrate other projects and cooperation partners form inside and outside Cardano, carry out a literature review and interviews with experts, analyze the results and summarize in a document” and so on. We know that these activities will be worked on “all during the third quarter of 2022”, but I would like the time division to be more specific. What happens in the first month of work, and the second, and the third? How long would each of these activities take to be developed, who would be responsible for this? Can some activities happen in parallel or one at a time? I believe that all these details could be included, so that our understanding would be even more solid about the development of the project. Talking now about the budget, an amount of 25 thousand dollars is asked, which is explained in great detail. We know how many parts the total amount would be divided into, which parts and also how many hours of work each of them would take, for example project management would cost 500 dollars, taking 10 hours to do, so we know the exact value of the hour of work ( $50) for that specific action. The same is reported for the other topics. Finally, analyzing the team, I think this part is good but the descriptions of each member should be a little longer. We know their professional names and roles, as well as their linkedin profiles, and good trust is passed from there. We also need to take into account that they have already presented other designs for DLT 360, so they have already demonstrated in service what they are capable of. If there was more detail about their careers, I think our level of knowledge would increase and that part would be even better supported.

      "The KPIs presented by the proponents are great ways to audit the proposal development process, as they are both quantitative (such as KPI 2 - Number of partners and projects/initiatives in interaction) and qualitative (such as KPI 1, Progress of activities as described above). My question is really about how this data will be verified by the Cardano community. I think there will be monthly meetings with the IOG coordinators, as is the standard, where the partial results will be presented. But will this information later be accessible to all members of the Cardano community? And if so, how? We have several communication platforms (eg telegram and discord) where these reports could be shared. As well as the goals achieved so far, I think it is important that we have an idea of ​​what the work routines of the professionals involved were like. As I see it, these are the two fundamental parts of composing progress reports (tasks and goals). Turning now to the final results, the proponents claim that success would be seen through the total achievement of the aforementioned KPIs, or that it would be measured starting from a specific number (for example, it would already be considered a success if the “number of great partners and interacting projects/initiatives” was greater than 5). I think it's a very objective way of thinking about what we want to achieve, but again how will the Cardano community be aware of all this? It would be very interesting for proponents to participate in something synchronous, before or after Town Hall, so that they could fully present how the entire development process of this initiative was, if the initially desired results (the greater clarification of what web3 is and metaverse) have been reached; examples of formed partnerships; how it impacted Cardano's gaming sector and etc. In other words, the auditability is good, yes, but it could be even a little more in-depth, in my view. \n",

What we are looking for here is the benefit of East Asia, that is, a direct investment in this part of the continent, so that it can prosper economically, environmentally and humanitarianly. At the same time, of course, we need our blockchain to also take advantage of the situation, that it be popularized, that the number of Ada holders increase, that new digital wallets are created, CNFTs minted, Dapps built and so on. The proposal in question aims to promote some face-to-face meetings in Japan, which promote Cardano, giving lectures on our blockchain and its technologies, so that investors, technology students and blockchain enthusiasts (as the proponent himself lists) are captivated to adopt. Ada/Cardano on the Bitpoint market. The proponent explains that Cardano is now officially available for the Japanese market, but this does not exclude the presence of competitors, other more famous and widespread blockchains both in that country and around the world (such as bitcoin and ethereum, for example). In fact, the promotion of such events can generate more knowledge about Cardano, so that people discover the advantages of our blockchain compared to others, and are motivated to adopt it. The idea can cause a boom for our ecosystem in Japan, as we wanted in the challenge, and with that also directly benefit the Japanese, who can discover job opportunities (both as CAs and vCAs, or as developers/designers/advertisers/etc in the Catalyst funded projects), for example. The problem that I identify here is that everything is very good in the theoretical field, but in practice, little is explained about these face-to-face meetings. The proponent claims that most things, like their location, speakers, translators, etc., would be defined post-funding. As a result, we were unable to understand how these events would be constituted in practice, and especially what specific issues would be addressed here; this, in my opinion, is the scope of the project and we would really need to have this notion so that we could trust and fully understand the practical part of the thing. Therefore, I will give it 3 stars, because I think the idea is promising, but the impact is not well assured (it is not possible to understand and trust it) due to the lack of explanations and details. \n",

      "Unfortunately, a serious error occurs here. The proponent states that a plan will be made if they are financed. But for the funding to become a reality, we need to know several things about the project, including the planning, the roadmap. One thing must not come after the other, but before. All the things that the proponent claims are defined should already be present and well explained, namely: best locations for events, list of speakers, team of translators, etc. Therefore, I will suggest what an ideal schedule would look like in my view. First of all, we would need to know how many events would happen. How often too, for example a total of 5 events, 1 each month. Then we would need to know their exact location, as it is said, the list of speakers and translators. We would need to understand what would happen on each day of the event: the moment of the talk itself, then an open chat session, perhaps? Would some community members who already have funded and ongoing projects participate to report their experiences? Would there be a coffee break, where the focus would be networking? What exactly would happen in those moments of the encounter? What topics would be covered in each lecture? How would the aforementioned target audience (investors, students, blockchain enthusiasts) be contacted and enticed to participate here? Anyway, in addition to all the characteristics of the event itself, I would like to know how the pre-production process would take place, which activities would have to be provided before the meetings, and by whom. Ideally, the total time should be divided into months, and those into weeks, and that the activities of each week should be listed. And for the script to be 100% it would also be interesting to know when things would happen, for example, in June, the first event in city X. Now talking about the budget, a total of 15k USD is requested, which is a high value taking into account account that we do not even know how many events would be made. The explanation of the budget division should have been more detailed, for example, how do they ask for 1500 dollars for rent if they don't even have the locations defined yet? What if there is no money or money left for that part? What salary for translators, how many hours would they work? And finally, about the team, we are told the names and main functions of each involved. However, we would need more details here as well. I would like to know a small CV of each, examples of previous work, linkedin profiles of everyone (only those of some people are available), and that the relationship of each one of them with Cardano be explained more deeply (we know this information about some , but not all). Therefore, the viability of the project is not good, it has a lot to improve, mainly in the script part. \n",

      "This topic is also not good, the auditability is low. Regarding the roadmap, for example, we have little information that would serve as ways to measure progress. We know that the number of participants, digital wallets and interactions on social media are indicative of how big the reach of these meetings is. However, it is necessary that we know much more profound and varied information about the development of the project than just numbers. Starting with the improvement of the script. Without a detailed schedule, the Cardano community would not have the means to properly audit the project process, as we would not know what has to be done, when and by whom. We don't have small goals to continually achieve, nor deadlines to meet. Therefore, it is essential that this be resolved. Afterwards, the team must maintain direct and constant contact with the Cardano community. Some members of our community could be chosen, preferably Japanese, who could maintain closer contact with this team in order to receive feedback at least monthly. These feedbacks would serve to inform us not only about how many people attended the event that month or how many people are registered on the project's social networks, but also to understand the construction of everything done during the pre-production process. Regarding the final result, we know that the main objective is to strongly drive the adoption of Cardano in Japan, especially since our blockchain is officially available in this market now. But how can we understand this impact? The simplest way, in my opinion, is to do a direct survey with the participants of the events. Are investors investing in Ada? Did they buy a lot, delegate to any community pools? Are young students now captivated by learning about our technologies, such as the Plutus programming language, and do they intend to work on our projects in the future? How did the enthusiasts behave after the events? All this would need to be raised, summarized and taken to the community, whether through written forms, sharing of personal questionnaires (of course, with the proper authorization of each person involved there), video calls and etc. Therefore, as well as feasibility, I believe that this topic of the proposal needs to be reviewed and improved. \n",

      "The proposal fits partially with the objectives of the challenge, because it seeks to translate an existing application into Vietnamese, aimed at teaching people about how to acquire and delegate Ada. I say that it does not meet 100% of what we are looking for because Vietnam is not located in the geographical region targeted by the challenge, East Asia, but close to it. However, I believe that it is always good to make content related to the Cardano ecosystem accessible to the most varied number of people, and the most solid barrier we face in this process is linguistics. I am sure that Vietnam is a very strategic country for us to invest in, I say this because I have already evaluated several proposals aimed at it in the previous fund, it is a country that has a lot of activity in the cryptographic world. Instruction is never enough, so in the application there could be a guide with basic concepts about the Cardano ecosystem, such as what cryptocurrency, blockchain and a pool are, in order to clarify this initial part in case someone downloads the application out of curiosity but doesn't know it well. indeed to Cardano. I think the project will succeed because it is not something new, the author already has this application translated into several languages, according to himself; what would happen here would be just another version of a project that is successful. As much as it is not focused on the geographic point we want to invest in, I believe that by being close it would have an effect as necessary, increasing the number of Ada holders, transactions on our blockchain, delegations in community pools, etc. are the objectives of the current challenge. So I'll give it 4 stars (I would give it 5 if it was geared towards an East Asian country/language). \n",

      "We have the necessary information, but not to a degree of detail that I find satisfactory. I will explain: we know that the project will be executed by two people, the developer and the translator. Despite having a lot of experience and a successful application, we lack accurate information about who the author is. What's your name, academic background, example of other apps he's developed (I'd like to see them on my phone's play store), how does this person relate to the Cardano ecosystem? As much as he claims to be experienced and successful, it is always good to see examples of the work of the people involved in practice. And about the translator, I think the same; who would it be? How would you be selected? Does he have any knowledge about blockchain? What are examples of your previous work? I think trust is passed on to the bidder by the fact that the app already exists, but it would be even more interesting if we had a complete picture of who he is and his translator. Regarding the process, it is not detailed how long each of the two activities would take to happen. The development of this project should be specified in weeks, or months, I believe it would not take that long to do it since it is not highly complex, but a more detail would help the CAs, vCAs and voters to have a more solid view of the process . And about the budget, it's a low value for the standard of Catalyst proposals, but as we don't know how long this work would last we can't know the hourly value of those involved. Therefore, I suggest that such details be included, so that we can have a deeper understanding of the whole. We have what it takes, but not in such a detailed way as to be great. That doesn't mean it's not a viable enough proposal, what I said were some suggestions on how to improve it. \n",

      "Finally, when we talk about auditability, we know how to objectively measure the success of this proposal. This would happen through the amount of app downloads by the population of Vietnam. But as I have suggested for other translations of this same project, I think it is important that we always do a human analysis in parallel with numerical statistics. I think this could be done in two ways: one more immediate and the other long term. Thinking immediately, surveys could be carried out in the app itself, after just a few days of use, to collect data such as: are users participating in other ways in the activities of the Cardano ecosystem, beyond the app? Are people getting to understand, even if not so deeply, how the cryptographic world works? Are they participating in Catalyst? And in the long run, the author could contact those same users via email to do a deeper analysis, with those same questions but a little more specifically, perhaps. Could an analysis of the overall picture of Cardano Vietnam also be carried out, has the community there intensified its activities? Maybe the media started to give more space to our blockchain, was there an increase, even if small, of investment in the Ada currency? It would also be important for us to follow the process beyond the results, and this would be done more effectively if the author had established a detailed timeline on the feasibility part. In addition, auditability exists, although it is more focused on numbers, it is not a complex proposal, so its monitoring should not be that difficult either. \n",

      "I found this proposal too vague. Basically, around 120 dollars are requested to cover the costs and needs of the team of professionals who work entirely in the Revealar group. This group, it is said, has the function of creating “APIs to generate, coin, manage and provide chain analysis for game developers in Cardano. It is a platform-as-a-service for developers to release and manage their games on-chain, with a healthy combination of open-source features, transparency in business operations, and community engagement.” The problem I identified here is precisely the fact that the proposal is abstract, we know who these people are and what they do, but we don't know exactly what would come out of this proposal itself. In the part of the script, as I will analyze in detail the feasibility, we are informed of some activities, such as that in June an accounting report process would be carried out (what is the difference between this type of report and the others?). What would this report report? What would the overall progress be in the “NFT Game Engine of the engineering, community, and launch platform cohort pipelines”? Everything that is said seems rather vague to me, as a series of activities that will contribute, as I understand it, to different projects and purposes. I'm not saying that this is not beneficial for Cardano, but the present challenge is intended to fund Dapps projects that help in the expansion of our blockchain. This would need to be measured through measurable actions, a logical timeline, a succession of phases that would result in a final scenario, which should be traced from the beginning, precisely on the impact part. I think 1) more information should have been provided about the Revealar group, examples of projects they've worked on, what kind of games they've helped develop and how they've helped. Examples would be essential for people like me who don't know the group before. I went to the website they made available to try to get to know them better, but this information should be attached to the proposal itself 2) which projects they will continue to work on with this funding, what impacts are expected for Cardano within the various possibilities that the development of several projects could generate, how could we make such information clearly measurable... In short, my opinion is that there is not so much confidence in the impact of this proposal as it is explained, in my view, in a very abstract and broad way. \n",

      "As I mentioned in the previous topic, the script details what would happen in time intervals that I think are inappropriately long; for example 2 months, when a maximum of 1 month between one phase and another is ideal in my opinion, so that we could keep the specificity level high. The tasks described are well explained, but it is not clear to me if they are all interconnected, forming part of a larger project, or if they would be, for example, services provided for different external projects. Really, it gets very confusing for me about what constitutes the development process of this project, we know what would happen, but I can't see clearly why it would happen or how it would happen. I think the proponents should have clarified whether all the actions encompass the daily activities of the group, that is, the mentoring of different projects that involve the technologies of the Cardano ecosystem; or if they are part of a single process. Regarding the budget division, the amount requested is very high, above the average that we found in the Catalyst proposals. This amount would encompass a series of very varied expenses, as mentioned by the proponents in the impact, it would cover (from what I understand) the salaries of all professionals who make up the Revealar fixed team. Some expenses are fully understandable, while others could be better explained. For example, what would the utilities be, and why would they cost a total of 5100 dollars? Why would cloud infrastructure cost $15,000? It is important that these technical parts are well broken down, so that all types of readers of the proposal understand it equally, even those who do not work in the technology sector. About the marketing and public relations campaign, how would it be developed? What marketing strategies would be used? By the way, what exactly is being released? The public relations cited are about establishing partnerships with whom, and for what purpose? Speaking at the end of the team presentation, we are introduced to only 3 professionals. This surprises me, because from what is described, the Revelar group is multidisciplinary, containing professionals from various areas, even in terms of the budget division, this is clear; why then only 3 people are presented? Anyway, in relation to them, I think the information is relevant and satisfactory, we got to know them well through a description of their CVs, how they work in their professions, previous experiences, how they are inserted in the Cardano ecosystem , and their linkedin profiles are also available, where we can see all this information in a more objective and proven way. It's the best part of feasibility. Therefore, I will give it a neutral note, the feasibility is not bad, it has good things, but it also has many aspects to be improved (mainly the script). \n",

      "The proponents do a good job of auditing the process, providing several ways in which the Cardano community could check on progress. I think they define the issue of platforms very well (it would be possible to follow the activities on the website they created, the github repository and through reports that they did not specify where they would be made available). However, it is not so clear 1) how often updates would be made on each of these platforms 2) which content would be updated 3) whether they would only provide updates on the goals achieved or also on the work routine of fixed professionals, as well as as if payments were being allocated as promised. I think there is a lack of clarity about what would be discussed in the meetings with the IOG coordinators, what we should look for on the website where they made it available (I accessed it and found it a bit confusing, I suggest that the user experience design be reviewed)... Anyway, the auditability of progress does exist, but like the rest of the proposal, it's kind of confusing, we don't know what to really expect and what to look for, when and how often. Talking now about the final result and the success scenario, all topics are very abstract, revealing neither quantitative nor qualitative indicators of how to measure success. The single most objective topic is the last one (“Most importantly: Reveal is active with commercialized offerings and integrating new developers into the Cardano NFT Gaming ecosystem and growing month by month until the end of 2022”). Otherwise, I don't think we're presented with easily measurable data. In my view, it lacked a sense of how we can perceive success for both the Relevar platform itself and Cardano. How many projects were developed with the assistance of this team? Which ones are they? What technologies from the Cardano ecosystem do they work with? How did the Relevar group grow and evolve in the 6-month period that this project covers? Speaking now more specifically about our blockchain, how were the specific goals of the challenge achieved? Have high impact Dapps been developed, new members added to our community? Has the volume of Ada and CNFTs in circulation increased in the face of this project? Unfortunately, the proposal in my opinion is unspecific, mainly in impact and auditability, and needs to be revised. \n",

      "Theoretically, this proposal perfectly meets what we are looking for in the present challenge, because our objective here is to disseminate content related to the Cardano ecosystem in a more traditional media, outside the bubble we already dominate (mostly, youtube). If episodes of a documentary series were created, covering topics such as what is blockchain, Cardano, cryptocurrency, etc., in an easy language that was capable of transmitting knowledge about our blockchain in a safe and accessible way, and these contents were released in the System Public Broadcasting (PBS), as the author suggests, certainly the objectives of the challenge would be achieved. As our proponent says, there is still a lot of prejudice and speculation about what blockchain is, most of the public only knows famous concepts like Bitcoin and NFT, and sees the crypto world only as an attempt to get rich quick, and we know that it is not. well so. It would be amazing to take Cardano's message (how we are an ecosystem that has as its main objective to make the world a better place, investing in solving problems in several different areas and working with technology to gradually achieve such improvement) to a larger audience and above all different from what we are used to dealing with. So I think that in theory this proposal is perfect for the challenge, but we also have serious problems here in terms of detail. Several important pieces of information are missing, such as: how many episodes of this documentary series would be produced; what exact topics would be covered in each; who would be the Cardano expert who would mentor the project, providing all the technical information; how would these episodes be created (through the reporting of real situations involving Cardano? Interviews with subject matter experts?); where exactly would these episodes be, I mean, in which country/cities would we be trying to get this content out on PBS? Anyway, I think the author was very accurate in his idea but he didn't elaborate it well enough for us to have confidence in the impact, peace of mind that there is enough planning for what was promised to be fulfilled and with that the goals would be achieved. I suggest that the proposer further develop his proposal in order to increase confidence in the impact of his project. \n",

      "Unfortunately, all parts of the feasibility are superficial, and as with impact, they needed much more detail to convey security. Regarding the team: we don't know who the team is or even if the project would be developed only by the proponent. He claims to be an engineer, with more than 20 years working on PBS stations, having many hours working on local TV productions (but local from where) and contacts with important people in the business. But all this information is still quite abstract. I would like to know: his name, what city he works in, examples of some previous productions he has developed, who are these relevant people he has networking and also if he has any connection with Cardano, any experience with our blockchain, if he is a member active in our community, if you have already worked with something related to Cardano and etc. In this way, we would be able to know in a solid way. It would also be important for him to clarify whether he would work alone or in a group, and in the second case, to detail in an equally detailed way who the other people involved would be. He mentions having networking, if he preferred not to name names he could have said more or less how these people could help, for example. Regarding the script, we don't have one, we don't know with solidity what the project development process would be here, which phases would have to be fulfilled for the final result to be obtained, how many episodes there would be, how long it would take for each one to be produced (we know that the release is weekly), as I said about impact, what are the specific subjects of each episode, who would be the people who appeared in it and/or would help create it... Anyway, there are many details missing, a schedule divided into weeks so that we knew what would be done, how, when and by whom. And finally as far as the budget is concerned, it is also explained very lightly, asking for 10k USD which would be split between “time and travel - $2,500” and “external consulting fees - $5,000”. But how so? Tenderer working time? And how long? How many hours would he work, and for how many weeks? And what are these trips, from where to where, and why would they be necessary? These external consulting fees, what exactly would they be? It's unclear whether it's tax or the cameo of subject matter experts, who would help create the episode. So I don't think the feasibility of the project is good enough, we have a lot of things to improve here. \n",

      "As with the first two topics, this one needs a lot of detail. Varied and detailed information is not given in a precise way that could serve as a reliable means of monitoring the proposal. I don't quite understand how the author suggests that we measure progress. Would these meetings between the actors be the face-to-face meeting between him, the proponent, and the Cardano experts he would consult to create the episode? And about the measurement of success, this is also not explained clearly, but from what I understand it would be in relation to the number of episodes spent on the PBS network and its audience reach. I will suggest improvements. For the process: the tenderer must, first of all, draw up a detailed schedule. From this, the Cardano community would have accurate material to monitor in relation to progress, that is, we would know what to check if the right thing was being done at the right time, by the right people and in the right way. We could follow if the activities were going in the expected flow. It would also be interesting if the proponent gave us gradual feedback, for example at the end of each episode: if it turned out the way it was expected, if they managed to convey it as desired, how was the audience's reception, etc. And for the result: it is certainly important to control the numerical factors (how many episodes were produced and how many people were reached with it, who was the audience), but a more qualitative analysis is also necessary. By that, I mean, for example, how did the audience embrace this episode? Was there a good answer? Was there interaction? At the end of the project, has there been an increase in interest in Cardano in the locality where it was launched? Has there been an increase in research on our blockchain, has it become popular there, even if significantly? It would be ideal for the proponent to also do this general survey after all the episodes are released, so that we can understand exactly what their impact was on the public and how it affected the Cardano ecosystem: if new wallets were created, if there was an increase in investment in Ada, a growth in Catalyst participants and so on. In general, I liked the idea a lot, but I think it lacked detail to develop it in all aspects, if it is revised and improved I really believe it is something very interesting to be financed. \n",

      "The idea is good in theory, but there was a lack of explanations to understand how this Dapp would work in practice and also how beneficial this would be for Cardano. It is a place where people can store personal information such as their names, addresses, ages, allergies, etc., as well as health-related data. First problem I've identified here: what kind of data? “Health data” is something very broad, and can include exams they performed, appointments scheduled, history of exam results, treatments they undergo, medicines they take, in short, many things that are not specified here. It is said that this information would be anonymously coined on the platform, and in case doctors/institutions wish to have access to it, a fee would be paid to people in Ada. This is the only relationship between this application and our blockchain, and honestly, it doesn't seem to be valid enough to justify the 888 thousand dollars requested as an investment. We do not know for example how often these fees would be paid; how those interested in this information would find this data; what is the approximate amount paid for each information provided; anyway, we know little about how this Dapp would work in practice. Besides selling their data, what could users do here? The proponent claims that furiously, Dapp would integrate other solutions pertinent to the Cardano ecosystem, such as our decentralized Atala Prism identities, that medical data would be processed through smart contracts (what data?) and etc. However, all this still seems like a promise to me, because we don't know when or how these other technologies would be integrated here. Unfortunately, I don't think that this proposal represents a good positive impact for Cardano, due to the lack of explanations of what the Dapp functions would be; and also for the lack of certainty as to how this would achieve the specific objectives of this challenge, which would be, in short, to popularize Cardano; through various strategies, such as: greater adoption of Ada (this would be done on a small scale, as I understand it), sum of new active members in the community (how to ensure that users of this Dapp will explore the other possibilities that Does Cardano have?), more active tokens being minted, more smart contracts being made on our blockchain, etc. \n",

The tasks necessary for the accomplishment of the whole are not explained, they are only mentioned. For example, in “Developing iOS Apps”. What small activities would be necessary for this larger goal to be achieved? Mobile application development is extremely complex, requiring the continuous work of programmers and designers at the very least. What would they do here, what would their work routines be, what demands would they have to deliver weekly, for example? All activities are just mentioned, it would be necessary for each one of them to be broken down, so that we have a way to understand exactly what would happen, how, who would do it and when. Speaking of time, the given intervals are very extensive, each activity described would take months to be done, it would be necessary for the proponent to define more exact metrics of how we could control what would be done monthly, for example (ideally weekly). Turning now to the budget, the asking value is extremely high, the highest I have in all the proposals I have analyzed so far. To justify the need for an investment that takes on such a high proportion of the entire amount allocated to the challenge, it would be necessary for long explanations to be provided on how the amount would be divided; it would be essential that each of the parts was detailed in detail, so that we could understand how the money would be used and why so much money was requested. However, that is not what we see happening here. You see, the proponent claims that $270,000 would go toward \"leading engineering, full stack development.\" All that money would go to just one person? How many months would she work on the project, what would her hourly work be worth (and why so expensive?). Orders are $135,000 for Cardano Mithril lightweight client integration (what is this? Why does it cost that much?). Regarding the team, we don't know anything about those involved. We do not know their names, their resumes, previous experiences, how they relate to Cardano, why they are qualified for this project, their linkedin profiles, in short, we do not know who they are or why they would be qualified to develop this proposal.

We do not know how the work of the professionals involved would be monitored, not least because we do not have a detailed roadmap that allows us to have exact knowledge of what would be done and when. For the situation to improve, it would be necessary for the bidder to first detail the roadmap, so that we have content to base ourselves on when monitoring the work routines of the team members. It would be necessary for the team to prepare periodic reports with partial advances, small monthly achievements, for example, and make them available to the entire Cardano community (it could be through a website they created, online tools like Notion, google docs, or even the our community's telegram channel, for example). The meetings with the IOG coordinators, in order to promote an audit of the process, were not mentioned here, it would be necessary for the team to maintain this contact with them as well, and that all updates discussed in the meeting were duly disclosed to the members in our ecosystem . Speaking now about the final results, the auditability of this part is also basically null, because the proponent does not inform us anything different from what is already described in the impact of the proposal. How could we find out if the project was so successful in terms of benefiting users, in terms of controlling their health data, if they are somehow profiting from it, receiving in Ada, investing the amounts received...? And mainly, as we can see in a verifiable and objective way how all this reflected in the Cardano ecosystem, if these users would be getting involved with the community, becoming active members, understanding what is the differential of Cardano in relation to other blockchains, if they would be acquiring more Ada in addition to what is provided as rewards in Dapp and etc. We don't know how to measure the success of either Dapp itself or its impact on our blockchain. It would be necessary for this information to be gathered, and as with the partial results, it would need to be made available in a simple and practical way to all members of our community.

      "I found the game interesting, in general it is about profiting through NFTs, where the player could “merge” pre-existing NFTs to form a new, rarer one. The intention is that some NFTs will only be generated from combinations at certain times of the year, so that they are really special. I didn't understand very well what the profitability of the players would be. How would they profit from selling the NFTs directly? Would this sale happen in the game itself or on an external platform? In other words, would there be a marketplace here? Other than what I explained, no further information about the game is given. We don't know if there would be mini games within the game, which players vary with the NFTs once they were possessed... would they be a kind of virtual pet, would they need to be fed? Would they go through some challenges? Would they level up? Aside from minting the NFTs on the Cardano blockchain, are there other ways the ecosystem would benefit from this game? Would people need to create digital wallets? Would there be transactions in Ada? Overall, I think it's a great idea in terms of it seems to be an attractive game by nature, let alone if players actually make a profit from it. However, I think there was a lack of more details about the rest of the game, we couldn't fully understand how it would be built, what parts it would be made of, what activities would be developed there, that is, how its gameplay would be. It's also unclear whether there would be any other benefits to Cardano besides the minting of the NFTs itself. So, despite being something that I liked at first and could even meet the objectives of the challenge, which are in general to popularize Cardano through games, as the gaming public has a lot of potential to become active in the community, it's not as clear as that. would be done. I recommend that the proponent improve the explanations both about the game itself and the other possible benefits it could generate for the Cardano ecosystem. \n",

      "The script presented is very superficial. All we know is that the first couple of months would build the “dAPP including SC or server backend logic that runs the game by sending NFTs to a specific address. Here too the designs of the game elements will be finalized.” However, what small activities would be needed to build the dAPP? A project like this is very complex, requiring the work of several professionals (programmers, designers, narrators, illustrators, etc.). There would be several people performing several different activities. The way it is presented to us, the roadmap gives us a general idea of ​​what would be done, but in reality what we need is for the proponent to explain what would be done monthly in detail. That is, exactly what activities would be performed, by whom, how, for how long and in what order. The Dapp building process involves many things, each of which should have been informed and detailed. In the period of 3 to 4 months, an initial “mint at mint cost” would be made of the first NFTs that will be used by our connection game.” I don't understand what this means. The bidder should be more clear with his explanations, detailing exactly each activity that would need to be done. Now talking about the budget, 3 thousand dollars are requested, I found a very low value for the complexity of the project. However, it would still be necessary to understand how the work routine of the developers and the designer would be, because it is said that they would work on the project in their spare time, which can be a long or extremely short time. Without knowing exactly how many hours they will dedicate to the project, we have no idea of ​​the value of their work hours (although it will be well low, probably because of the total amount.) The team's presentation is quite abstract. The developers talk a little about themselves claiming that they have experience in Cardano through NFTs and are a pioneer s Plutus. However, it would be necessary for them to be more specific in their presentations. I would like to know their full names, which areas of training exactly they have, in addition to their experience in our ecosystem, which previous and parallel jobs they have already developed, it would also be positive if they attached their linkedin profiles. Regarding the designer, it would be much better if they already had someone defined for the position, as we cannot trust the preparation to execute the proposal on someone we don't know. Therefore, I think the feasibility of the project is not good, and it tends to improve in the three fundamental points (script, budget and team). \n",

      "I think the proponent is already off to a good start in auditability when he suggests that we monitor “monthly users, tagged secondary NFT sales, and reviews/articles about the game and community size”. All this data must be measured from the moment the game is released. In the meantime, it would be necessary to monitor the work routine of those involved. Therefore, it is necessary that the proponent prepares monthly reports, containing in the first months feedback and updates on how the Dapp development activities are happening, if there were any problems and how they were overcome, in short, information on how the process is progressing. game pre-release. And after being launched, the reports must contain the data previously suggested by him. This report should be available in a simple and direct way to all members of the Cardano community. It would be interesting to use tools like Miro or Notion, which allow text and images to be attached (drafts of NFT characters, I believe). Finally, regarding the auditability of the final results, success is imagined as “Build a game that is used by many Cardano fans and allow them to convince friends to try Cardano in a simple and fun game, thus increasing the Cardano community with people who are mostly casual mobile game players.” Right, but how will we be able to monitor whether this scenario has actually come true? I think the proponents lacked a more practical and scalable monitoring strategy. Once these strategies are put into practice, the results of the surveys should also reach the Cardano community, either through Town Hall meetings or even the elaboration of a larger and more detailed report compared to the monthly reports. on partial results. So I think auditability is ok, but it still needs to be further explored and the bridge between the Cardano community and the project team (and the information about it) needs to be better built. \n",

      "This proposal is confusing, the idea itself seems good to me but its explanation is not clear and not enough details are provided to understand the Dapp itself. I'll try to explain what I understood: a Dapp would be made whose main objective would be to collect data from motorcyclists, to avoid the increase in crimes associated with this portion of the population (according to the proponent, from robberies to sexual crimes). The logic would be that the more data we had on motorcyclists, the less chance we had that these were criminals. And this data would be somehow related to the Cardano blockchain, I don't know if DIDs would be made for each biker, it's not clear how the technologies from our ecosystem would be used here. But to me, this idea doesn't make much sense, I don't think people who would be likely to commit crimes would spontaneously register on this Dapp. In my opinion, this is a good idea so that Kenyan motorcyclists can form a unified community that is constantly in contact with each other, that their personal information is transparent and inviolable to everyone, so whatever problems they have (for example if were accused of something unfairly), the data on the blockchain could act in their favor. However, I don't see how the “2. Make it easy to track rogue pilots” would be done, I think these crime-prone people would prefer to remain anonymous, go out of their way to go unnoticed. Therefore, I think that this proposal is not of high impact, I don't think it has been explained in a sufficient way for us to be convinced that the objectives of the challenge will be achieved. In this challenge, we are looking to fund projects that: 1) Benefit developing locations, working to improve security is really a benefit to Kenya. However, as I explained, I don't see much sense in these suspicious people joining the blockchain, so I'm not sure, unfortunately, whether its intended goal would be achieved. 2) It is also necessary for the Cardano ecosystem to take advantage of the situation, in which case, as I said, it is not clear how the technologies in our blockchain would be used. We don't know if DIDs would be created for motorcyclists; what information would be minted from smart contracts; whether there would be any transactions in Ada; if somehow CNFTs would be related to this project. Anyway, unfortunately, from what is shown, the impact does not seem very safe to me. \n",

      "There is no roadmap for carrying out this proposal, all we know is what will be done in general: “carry out a survey of boda boda pilots in an area of ​​Kenya and collect relevant data on identity documents, certifications and training and relevant experience in the rule of law”. Who would carry out this research? In which cities in Kenya? How would motorcyclists be enticed to participate in this, how would they be approached? What questions would be asked? What kind of information would be added in this Dapp? It would be necessary for the proponent to draw up a schedule detailing which activities would be carried out and within how long, which deadlines would need to be respected, etc. In the final part of the proposal, in auditability, we know that the research phase would take 4 months to happen. What would happen in the first month, and in the second, and so on? It would be necessary to identify what would be done, by whom, in which weeks and with what specific objectives. The Dapp development part would take another 4 months, so I would like to understand who the tech professionals involved here would be and what they would do. How would the Dapp programming, UI/UX design, advertising, in short, everything be done... And in terms of money, a total funding of 20 thousand dollars is requested, which are divided into small parts, but each one of them should be more detailed so that we have a more concrete idea of ​​how the money would be used. Why would interviews cost $2,000, how many people would be interviewed, so what would be the value of each individual interview? That training that would cost a thousand dollars, who would be trained and to do what? Because the dissemination of research results would cost 2 thousand dollars, where would this content be disseminated, in order to reach how many people? And finally, talking about the team, we have a good breakdown of who they are. We know a little bit about what they have done so far professionally, examples of previous work, their linkedin profiles (not everyone, it would be important that everyone had provided this data), I would also like to know what roles they would play in the project. In general, trust is conveyed in this team. Therefore, I believe that the feasibility of the project is ok, but still with parts to improve. \n",

The question remains, how would these data be presented both to the local population of Kenya, which according to the attached youtube video needs as much support, as much as the Cardano community would be aware of this information gathering? I think it was necessary for the proponent and his team to collect such data monthly, or at least at the end of each work cycle, and make them available as well as a brief summary of the process that was necessary for data to be obtained. For example, I would like this document, containing the partial results, to be posted in the “Project Catalyst” group, on the telegram, and for it to be forwarded to local Kenyan newspapers, some local means of communication that allow the inhabitants of the country to learn about what is happening. it's being done. Regarding the final results, “clearer understanding of the issues from data collected about riders and created an identity solution on Cardano to facilitate a smoother running of this unregulated industry”, how will this understanding be done? Through the surveys and data minted in Dapp? How will an analysis of the overall picture be carried out, so that we can understand if the intended objectives were actually met? I missed a better explanation in this part, I would like to understand not only what is objectified but also how it will be perceived. And as with the auditability of the process, that of the final results must reach the knowledge of the local population of Kenya and the members of the Cardano community, we need to understand if not only the objectives regarding the improvement of security in the country were achieved but also whether this project actually benefited our blockchain. Therefore, I would like this part to be more detailed and the bridge with the Cardano community and the population of Kenya to be securely established. I will give it 3 stars because I believe that the auditability is the best part of the proposal, but there are also things to improve. \n",

      "The idea of ​​this Dapp is very good and theoretically fits perfectly with the objectives of the challenge. In this challenge, we are looking to fund Dapp projects that are beneficial to the Cardano ecosystem, that make our blockchain popular, that increase the number of active members in the community, the amount of Ada in circulation, the commercialization of CNFTs and the largest number of smart contracts being registered on the Cardano blockchain, for example. In this case, this Dapp works precisely on the last topic I mentioned. The idea here is to allow ordinary users to add files and have them minted in smart contracts. As new data would be added, new smart contracts would be created. A good summary of what would be done here is present in the following excerpt: “Encrypted archives end-to-end and privacy-based system to transparently check the status of each application”. It is also interesting how the proponent explains that “encrypted data whose values ​​can only be read after the opening period or authorized authorities as needed”. This generates a greater sense of control and security in relation to what is being coined. The only issue that I identified about the impact is that the user experience could have been better explained, as well as some uses of the case could be exemplified. I'll explain my point better: we know what will happen, but we don't know how people outside the cryptographic universe would be educated about the activities developed here. How would a regular user, who has never had contact with blockchain, learn to use the benefits of this Dapp? How could it be made useful and accessible to everyone? Or would it really be built with a more specific target audience in mind, who already understand how blockchain technology works and already know how to handle the technologies in question? Regarding the use cases, I think the following: the explanation of how Dapp would work is great, as it is accessible to most readers (CAs, vCAs, voters, etc). The proposal is highly technical, however it was explained in relatively simple language. However, I still haven't been able to visualize in practice some examples of how this Dapp could be used in people's daily lives. For example: companies, some single individual, a group of people in a hub... If 1 or 2 examples of how it could be used were included in the explanation, I believe the level of understanding of the project as a whole would be increased. Therefore, I liked the proposal, I thought it is well aligned with the objectives of the challenge, it only needs a few improvements to become ideal in the impact part. \n",

      "The proposal script is ok. We know what activities would be developed and according to the months of the year. However, it would be even better if the proponent detailed each of the actions mentioned monthly in greater detail. For example, during the “Development of the Decentralized Bidding System”, what small steps would have to be completed for this development to take place completely? In May, the “Development of the decentralized application form filing system” would take place. Lay people in the development part (like me) don't understand exactly what the difference in work is between the development of the bidding system and the development of the application form filing system. That's why I think it would be important for the proponent to clearly delimit the work needed for one of those months, which professionals would do what, how and for approximately how long (it is not strictly necessary that the time be further broken down, although it would be highly positive if the work was also divided into weeks). Now moving on to the budget explanation, in my opinion this part also needed to be more carefully detailed. The bidder explains how the total money requested ($25,000) would be divided into a few blocks, these blocks being made up of various things. For example, the first one would be: “Smart contract + web3 + AI developer hiring salary = approx. $10,000 by January 2023.” How much would go to smart contract, and how much would go to AI developer salary? Approximately how many hours would this professional dedicate to the project, so that we can know the value of his work hour? As in this case, the other blocks could be better broken down, for example the marketing part, 3 thousand dollars are requested exclusively for this, but it is not explained what publicity strategy this project would have, which would be the places where it would be publicized, and how it would be publicized and so on. Finally, speaking of the team, unfortunately this part was the one that left the most to be desired, because we don't have details about each of those involved. We only know the professional roles for the project to become possible, however, it would be essential for us to know who would fill each of these vacancies; we would need to know them individually in order to convey a certain trust. It would be necessary for their full names to be informed, as well as their professional resumes, including previous jobs (so that we could get an idea of ​​what experiences they have), as well as how these people relate to our blockchain. Therefore, the feasibility still has a lot to improve, because in my view the information provided was very basic, especially on the part of the team. \n",

      "From what the proponent informs, the project development process could be accompanied by the construction of the site and the github repository. Theoretically, this is already what is necessary for the Cardano community to be able to gradually follow the process of building the Dapp. All that was needed was for the proponent to inform us more details about how these sites would be filled. For example, what content would build the site? How often would the github repository be updated? In addition to the gradual milestones, that is, the partial results obtained during the Dapp development process, would the proponent inform us about the work routine of the professionals involved? My perception is that we have the basis of what we need, but not a detail that makes us really understand how the updating of these sites will happen, that is, what the Cardano community will be able to follow little by little. Now speaking of the end scenario, success would really be the delivery of a “secure and transparent platform as a service for various governments as well as institutions for all their application archiving needs with systems to roll back everything”. The larger objective would be to help “substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all its forms”. I think that, in fact, this is the most sought-after goal, however, once again, it lacks detail. How would we be able to understand if these goals were in fact achieved? How could we know if Dapp was delivered in full and in the way it was promised? And how can we assess the way users are using these technologies? And, more importantly: how can we see the real impact of all this for the Cardano ecosystem? It is necessary for the proponent to clarify these issues. My suggestion is that he does a survey directly with users, in order to understand how the end use of Dapp is going, if they are managing to create smart contracts, minting their data on our blockchain in a totally inviolable and transparent way. In this way, we would have a real understanding of the impact that the project would be having on the public. In the same way, it is essential that the proponent do some research on how this Dapp helped to popularize our blockchain, increase the number of people who manage smart contracts and also if this all increased confidence in the technologies relevant to Cardano, in order to contribute for widespread adoption of our blockchain. So I think auditability is going the right way, but it still needs a review and more detail on both parts (auditability of progress and final results). \n",

      "The idea of ​​the proposal is great, but it is not clear how it could meet the objectives of the challenge. It can be very well summarized in the following excerpt: “Convert plastic waste for reuse, improve sustainability, reduce CO2 emissions and commercialize Carbon Credits in the Cardano Ecosystem”. The proponents intend to create a Hub whose target audience is Indians and the main activity is recycling, with the aim of transforming the linear economy into a circular economy, which avoids the burning (hence, the generation of pollution) of waste that could be reused. The proposal is clearly very beneficial for India, as it will act in the environmental cause, helping this country to be more sustainable. However, it is not clear how this project would benefit the Cardano ecosystem, I read the entire proposal carefully and I still don't understand it very well. It is said that the carbon credit would be traded in our ecosystem. But first, what is a carbon credit? And how would that relate to Cardano's technologies? What transactions would be minted on our blockchain, would Ada be used to trade these carbon credits? Would NFTs be generated somehow? Unfortunately, I do not consider the impact of this proposal to be clear for our ecosystem, I am sure about the beneficial consequences that the project would have for the country, and this is one of the things to be taken into account when thinking about whether the proposal aligns with the specific objectives of the challenge; however, we would also need to be sure in what ways this would all be interesting for Cardano, how it would help our blockchain gain more visibility and investment. Because of this very fundamental issue, I do not consider that the impact of the proposal is clear and, therefore, I am not confident in saying that it is in line with what is requested here. \n",

      "I do not consider the proposal's roadmap to be adequate. We know, through an extensive explanation, what would happen in the next months of the project's development. However, the problem is that the temporal notion is too abstract. Starting with the fact that the proponents say that these activities can take, together, from 3 to 6 months to materialize. One time interval is twice the other, so I wonder why such a large variation. Regardless of how many months the process as a whole takes, it would be important for proponents to be more specific about the timing of the script. By this I mean that it is critical that the time intervals are at least in months, that is, what would happen in month 1, month 2 and so on. In fact, the ideal is that there was a greater degree of detail, that the proponents, in addition to determining what would happen in each month, specify what would happen in the weeks of those months. Therefore, in my view, the script is superficial, even though they have described many activities to be carried out. Regarding the team, this part of the feasibility is great, we know the names of those involved and a lot of information about them, a small curriculum by which we can understand what their past experiences were. All, with the exception of Prem Philip, make their linkedin profiles available, which is very positive as it allows us to see in practice a conformation of the information given. It would have been better if everyone had made this link available, but maybe Prem doesn't have linkedin (I would like this to be clarified). That is, in relation to the team, trust is passed on, they seem to be able to successfully carry out the project. Finally, speaking of the budget, the team provides a link that theoretically should detail how the requested money would be used. But when I entered, there was nothing about this proposal, the content of the link actually refers to other proposals. We have no idea how the requested money would be used, so on this unfortunately no trust is passed on as we have no information. I believe that this failure is serious and profoundly compromises the viability of the proposal.

The link to the online Hub is provided, however the roadmap is not very specific, we know what needs to happen but not when it would happen, so a proper audit of this part of the proposal is also not possible. Proponents say that \"success will be measured by the number of individuals attracted and geographic coverage by the number of hubs formed\", but again, I don't see clear ways in which the Cardano community could verify this data. I think that in order to properly monitor the construction part of this project, there would have to be ways to audit the tasks and the partial results, not just the goals. Therefore, I consider that the audit of the process is quite inadequate. Now, talking about the end results, the success scenario, basically there are no specific goals, measurable objectives. The said information is extremely abstract, unfortunately the proponents do not define KPIs, metrics, quantitative and qualitative data that make it possible to safely monitor the project. We don't know how to measure the consequences of all this for India or Cardano. In other words, I think that this part of the proposal left a lot to be desired, the proponents do not provide enough and adequate information so that we could follow neither the development nor the results of this project; In my opinion, this topic would need to be completely reformulated to be satisfactory. \n",

      "I thought this idea was very good and important. It is about selling works produced by indigenous peoples, both in physical format and NFT, so that financial funds are raised that would be used to buy land and return it to these indigenous communities, so that they can regain control over areas they lost over the years. of the historical process (in this case, in the United States) and have full autonomy to administer them. This fits perfectly with the objectives of the challenge, because here we are looking to fund projects and Dapps that serve both to help marginalized communities in developing countries, whether in economic, health, education, etc.; and also benefiting the Cardano ecosystem, through the popularization of the blockchain, the creation of new Dapps, the minting of CNFTs, the purchase and delegation of Ada, the creation of digital wallets and etc. I think this proposal works very well on these two points. In this case, we would be helping a marginalized community in an already developed country, but that does not mean that it does not need support, since we know how the indigenous portion of the population often suffers from social exclusion and lack of resources. I found it very positive that the author of the proposal made available two articles that serve as an argument about the need to solve the problem that was raised. In my view, this should always be done, as it brings a lot of credibility to the proposal. And regarding the Cardano ecosystem, our blockchain would certainly benefit greatly from this project as well. Starting with the fact that NFTs would be created and traded on our blockchain, which would help new people get to know Cardano - maybe those interested in buying these works haven't heard about our blockchain yet, for example. Second, because this, if successful, would make our ecosystem reach one of the fundamental pillars of its mission, which is to help make the world a better, more democratic place, giving a “voice” to a portion of the population that sees itself marginalized. for a long time, not only in the United States but around the world. This would make Cardano not only an economic project but also a humanitarian one, which could even attract the attention of philanthropists who want to invest in social projects, but don't know exactly where. Therefore, I think the idea is theoretically perfect, just a few things that could have been reported so that we could understand even more about it: which indigenous peoples does the proponent intend to establish contact with, where in the United States would these lands be that he intends to be able to buy and at what approximate price.

Upon reading the impact, I thought that the proponent already had a structured plan on how to make their idea a reality, however, everything is still in a very early stage, of research. Starting with the fact that he didn't elaborate a roadmap, as I said, the proponent says that the project is in an embryonic phase, that during this phase the objective would be to build an action schedule for the next 6 - 12 months of the project. This should have already been made available by the time the proposal was launched on Catalyst, it is not feasible for the community to fund an idea that is not yet structured with 25 thousand dollars. We would need to know what would happen each month, what activities (in detail) would be done, by whom, by what deadlines and with what specific goals. We would need to know what would happen during the development process of this proposal, what would be the work routine of the professionals involved, how would the contact with these indigenous communities be, what would be the themes of the works created, how long approximately the first NFTs would be launched, how they would be disclosed so that potential buyers could get to know them, what estimated value... Anyway, we don't have any visualization of the process. Regarding the budget, the proponent does not make a division of how the requested 25 thousand dollars would be used, from what I understood everything would be used as an investment, both in the matter of waiting for Ada to appreciate and delegating this amount to some community pool, for rewards to be obtained. This money would be used to buy the first lands in the future, mint the first NFTs, pay the indigenous artists and so on. At least, that was my understanding. Once again, it is not feasible for IOHK to provide such a high amount just for investments, it would be necessary for this money to be broken down into parts that would make the project come true. For example 5k for the developers team, 2k for marketing and etc... And finally, speaking of the team, there is not one either, only the proponent, we know he would be the leader of this project, but we don't have enough information about him . In terms of relevant experience, we are informed that he is a systems analyst, he has an MBA and MPA, we know his linkedin and where we can get to know more directly the work he has developed previously. However, we don't know how this person relates to the Cardano ecosystem, if he already has some experience with our blockchain and which one, and with that we don't know if he is qualified to successfully execute this project. We would also need him to have already formed a team, which was properly presented with names, roles in the project, a professional resume and their linkedin profiles.

We know the metrics (“funds raised, communities served, artist agreements, things like acquired area”), but not what the work process would be for them to be conquered. What would happen in month 1, who would be working on what, so that X smaller goal would be achieved in what timeframe? Unfortunately, I can't see how we would monitor something that is as uncertain as the daily work of this project. Therefore, my suggestions are that at first this roadmap is built in detail, and after that the proponent and his future team make an overview of how the activities took place each month, not only of the partial results obtained, but also of how were their working hours, if everything went as planned, if any problems were faced, etc. And finally, about the final results, what the author points out is in fact the main goal: to buy land and return it to the indigenous communities. However, other parallel successes would be: the popularization of Cardano through the sale of CNFTs, new investors turning their eyes to our blockchain, individuals from the indigenous community who discovered through art a new way to generate income, etc. It would be necessary for the author and his team to raise all these issues and prepare a final report. In the specific case of this proposal, it is essential that we have both a written document that can prove sales of CNFT and purchase/donation of lands for indigenous peoples; and a synchronous video meeting with members of the Cardano community, in order to explain how the whole process took place, how the communities are after the project, if they were benefited in the way that was expected, which and how many lands were returned to them, where are located... It would be great if some of the changes felt by indigenous communities could be recorded on video, of course, if they allowed it and felt comfortable with it. This could generate interesting material even to be disseminated in traditional media (which could be related to the Audiovisual challenge of this fund), in order to create a certain marketing content for Cardano.

      "I didn't understand why this proposal was launched in the Africa challenge, because it doesn't say anything about the continent at any time. The idea is to create a new rewards system for customers who buy products or services from partner companies, once they make these purchases, they will receive a token minted on the Cardano blockchain that can be accessed through a QR Code. In the future, this token can be exchanged for some cryptocurrency or for local currencies, such as dollars, euros, etc. At least, that's what I understood from the proposal. I thought it was a good idea, because sometimes store rewards are not very useful, they are more about cashback for future purchases, where the customer is forced to spend even more to enjoy the benefit. The idea of ​​you having more autonomy in relation to the benefit gained, being able to use it now or in the future, if you prefer, is quite interesting. And involving our blockchain technology in this is great because it can organically attract new members to the Cardano community (people who are not necessarily interested in blockchain, but want their rewards, want a cashback in a way). I think this proposal is very positive in the sense of generating new members for Cardano and benefiting the ecosystem, as it would be compatible with both the challenge of the Dapps and the new members on board. However, the challenge in which it was launched aims, in addition to benefiting the Cardano ecosystem, to promote the improvement of the African continent, whether in an economic, social, environmental, etc. And at no point is it mentioned how the African people would especially benefit here. So as much as I liked the idea, it doesn't quite align with the challenge, so it's not fair that it gets a good grade on impact. \n",

      "A roadmap is not provided. Everything we know about the development process can be found in the following snippet: “I have regional cardano developers who can work with me, so in the next two months I believe the architecture and designs will be ready. The next couple of months could be collaborating with guys to let us build their payment system on us and sign contracts. By the end of 2022, we plan to launch the platform.” How will the proponent and fellow developers work for the next two months? For how many days a week, for how many hours a day? Doing what? They aim to launch the platform at the end of 2022, but until then, what will happen each month? It would be necessary for the proponent to detail what would be done monthly, enumerate the activities and describe each one of them in detail. As we are told, it is not possible to understand clearly what the day-to-day work would be like that would result from the final process. Regarding the budget, most of the money is intended to pay the salaries of the professionals involved. However, we do not have much knowledge about what their work routines would be like, as I have already mentioned. If we knew for how many months they would work, during the week, for how many days they would dedicate themselves to this project, for how many hours a day, it would be much more possible to understand how this money would be used. We have a portion of the budget dedicated to “other subscriptions and future unaccounted for issues”, which would be $3,000. I thought it was a very high value for us to not even know what exactly these things would be. Would they be unforeseen? If there was no problem, where would that money go? Finally, speaking of the team, the proponent states that he does not yet have a team. He says he thinks he's qualified to lead the developers, I believe he has the potential to be a good person for that, but I don't know if this is the moment because he seems to be still a little inexperienced, being at the beginning of his career. It would be much better for him to prove why he is qualified to take charge of the project through experience and previous work. It's also unclear what kind of relationship he has with the Cardano ecosystem. Regarding the other components, it would be much better if he had already introduced the team members, it is difficult to bet on the work of people who are not yet defined. And it is worth remembering that a good part of the funding would go towards this, towards the salary of those involved, so it would be more appropriate if there was already a team formed and that conveys confidence in relation to the preparation to carry out this project. Therefore, I think the feasibility is not good, having many points to improve. \n",

      "As I understand it, the proponent would monitor the project's progress at regular intervals via trello. Trello is an online tool used a lot in the design field, as I recall, as it allows a team to work on the same project at the same time. I think that this is a great way to audit the partial results of the project, it is enough that the time interval that will be used in this audit is really defined. In my view, at most 1 month to go from one update to another. All progress must be recorded there: how were the work routines of the professionals involved, if any problems were faced, if the small successes expected for this time step were reached... Github will also be used, which I think which is one more factor to improve the auditability of the project. Regarding the final results, the success scenario outlined by the proponent seems to me to be very much in relation to the adoption of companies for their token, I think this is a very practical and effective way of measuring success, after all, what we want is generate an alternative and more effective form of reward, which is advantageous for Cardano but also for the companies that work with it. I believe this is the way to audit the proposal, it is enough for this data collection to be taken to the Cardano community, which can be done, for example, through a meeting during Town Hall. The proponent can prepare a brief presentation containing information on whether companies have adopted their token, what reflection this had for Cardano, if in a way new people have also come to know and invest in our blockchain. What kind of impact did this have for the African continent (this part is still a mystery to me) and etc. I think that the auditability part was in fact the best part of the proposal, having only a few points to improve. \n",

(a problem that unfortunately is a reality); this could help the local population to have more confidence in the work of these institutions and provide more donations. An excerpt that sums up this proposal very well is this one, which explains that the DAO “will not only function to provide services for charitable projects, but it will also function as a place where community members vote on which charities they want to support with the funds.” collected”. That is, we know that in addition to helping with the issue of payments, the proponent promotes activities. But come on, why did I say the idea fits the theory well? In the field of practice, the proponent does not explain how these activities would be developed. How will cryptocurrency payments be implemented in charities? Which organizations does he intend to contact? How will you explain to them what blockchain is, what is the difference between Cardano and other blockchains, that is, what are the advantages and benefits of working with us? What are these activities that would be developed in DAOs? How would active members of the Cardano community be recruited to participate in this initiative? I think that, unfortunately, the practical implementation of these activities is still quite vague, so I think the idea may be very relevant, in fact, but it would need to be better explained. I would like to know how this activity would intertwine with the Cardano ecosystem, both in the sense of institutions getting to know our blockchain and its characteristics, as well as in the fact that it would be better explained what actions would be promoted by community members within the project, etc. \n",

The milestones to be reached could have been traced (the project is of enormous complexity, which increases the need to know small goals that must be achieved little by little); it would also be important for us to know how often these updates would be made. I think that's the way it is, it's important that the proponent makes the partial results visible to the Cardano community, but the explanation could be more complete as I suggested.

So these are my observations regarding the auditability of the process. Now talking about the final results, I think the notion of success established by the proponent is very vague. He says success would be the realization of a “fully decentralized community-led organization that accommodates charitable donations from anyone to any charity.” Okay, but how can this become measurable? It would be necessary for him to explain many more things, let's go: 1) which charities were benefited. It would be important for the institutions themselves to report this process, how Cardano contributed to the better establishment of donations, how transactions became easier and also what activities started to be developed from this project 2) how can we safely and securely perceive directly (through numerical data for example) how has the Cardano ecosystem benefited from this project?

      "In theory, this idea is very good, it is about creating software that can connect donors, non-profit organizations and who would receive the donation (as I understand it, it can be a family, a single individual, etc.). Transactions would be done on the Cardano blockchain and from what I understand DIDs would be used at some point in this project to identify the people involved. The objective is to help build nations through these donations and make governments and non-profit organizations realize the advantages of working with Cardano ecosystem technologies, which would generate mass adoption, according to the author. Donors could be aware of how their donations would be affecting the beneficiaries because there would be a platform that would establish this point, through chats, videos, etc. In other words, in theory everything is perfect, but I identified serious problems in this proposal. Let's go, starting with that the requested money corresponds to the total value of the challenge, 800k in dollars! It's not feasible for us as a community to put literally all our chips on a single idea. Second, although it is interesting to build software that works in the humanitarian field, and that dialogues with the specific objectives of the challenge, since we seek here to favor developing nations through support in more basic areas such as education, food, health et cetera (I believe donations would cover these areas), it's all very abstract. Which organizations does the author intend to contact? In which countries would this activity be developed, at least initially? How could we see how the efforts were rewarded? I believe the scale here is too macro. A little more specificity would be important, for example: we are going to focus on Latin American countries, our target audience for donating would be X, the people we aim to involve so that they donate are Y, and the organizations we are thinking of establishing contact with are Z. As it is said, it seems like a somewhat utopian and extremely expensive project, and as it does not focus on anything in particular, we cannot be sure that the objectives of the challenge will actually be met. So I suggest that the author review a few things, starting with the budget, it's not unreasonable to ask for all the challenge money for your project. I would like the proponent to tread a more palpable path on how all this would happen, we cannot bet on something indefinite. So, unfortunately, I'll give it a low rating, two stars, because I think the idea is the way we're looking, but there's a lot to be modified for it to be valid to be financed. \n",

Starting with the script. that does not exist, the author only vaguely included what would happen in the first and second year of the project. It would be essential to establish a time-based schedule, that is, first divide year 1 into quarters, and within these quarters explain what would happen according to the month at least. Each activity should be detailed, for example the research, where it would be done, with what methods, who would work on that part and how the results obtained would be organized and delivered. How the NGOs that would participate would be chosen and the justification for each of the choices, how donors would be attracted, as I also explained in the previous topic. Would this survey last the first month? What would happen in parallel, or would that be all? About software development, this is something very big and complex. How long would it last? Likewise, which small tasks would result in this whole, in the final product, in the developed software? How would the professionals involved here organize themselves? The information is passed in a totally abstract way. About the funding, nothing is explained about how it would be divided, we know that it would be used to develop the software, promote marketing, publicize it and so on. But how much would go to each park and why? What is the need to order 800k? What is the salary of the professionals involved? How would the publicity campaign be carried out, what specific expenses would it be? It is always necessary to justify how the money would be used in detail, especially if it is such an expensive project. Finally, basically nothing is said about the team, they are just listed which professionals would be involved, but we don't know any details about them. We need to know their names, backgrounds, what role they would play in the project, how they would work (for how many hours per week, for example), how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem and we would also need a way to verify all the information described, some online profile, whether linkedin, portfolios, your contacts on discord, telegram and etc. Unfortunately I don't know what happened here, maybe the proposer is not very knowledgeable about how to submit a proposal and the details it needs to include, I suggest you review your idea as a whole and provide all the details quoted here. \n",

      "Similar to the first two topics, the auditability of the project is very shallow. What we do know is that success can be measured based on numbers (number of NGOs involved, DIDs integrated, donations made, etc.). However, it is not just by quantities that we measure whether a proposal was successful or not, especially in this challenge, which aims to help developing countries to establish themselves better. It would be important to have a direct follow-up of those who received the donation, I believe it is just as important to know the number of people/families/places that have benefited. In this way, we could see if what was promised is being fulfilled. In the same way, it would be important to know if in fact NGOs and government institutions have realized the advantages of the Cardano ecosystem and have adopted its technologies, used our blockchain in some way. It would have to be something reciprocal: good for those who received the donations and also for us, who would finance the project and have our technologies at stake. This qualitative research should be done, in my view, by the project team itself, and the reported information should be made available to the entire community. Likewise, it would be essential to follow the project development process, but as there is no roadmap here, there are no ways to do that. To perform a monitoring, we would need to understand what we are trying to verify. Therefore, it is necessary for the team to establish specific tasks, so that some members of the Cardano community can follow them, perhaps through meetings with the software development, marketing, research teams, etc. Updates should also be shared with the rest of the community.

      "I found the video attached to the proposal very simple and didactic. I confess that by reading the text I could not understand the concept of the proposal, but after watching the video it became very clear. It is a platform where people can invest in different cryptocurrencies in a unique way, through what proponents call a basket. I think it's a very good idea for those who want to invest in the cryptographic world and don't really understand how, don't know how to work with brokers, convert one currency to another, etc. But I ask myself: to what extent is this beneficial for us? I believe that the goals of the challenge are basically to create applications, whether for mobile or web use, that: increase the number of Cardano users, intensify the amount of transactions on our blockchain, attract new Ada holders, that is, expand our ecosystem. This idea seems to me to be very useful for users, as it would make the investment process much easier (from the video, we can see how ergonomic the proponents' platform is, making it easier to understand and use). It is also very interesting how users would have the option of “copying” the baskets of others, that is, researching how other investors are organizing their investments and making the same strategy. Also, it is very positive how these people who were copied would be paid. Not enough, as I understand it, some fees of considerable value would be covered by the platform itself, that is: it is a perfection for users. But unfortunately, I'm not sure if it would be that advantageous for Cardano, in particular. Would it be interesting if we could clearly visualize how Ada would overlap with other currencies? At no point in the proposal is this issue clarified. The way the idea is presented to us, we understand that it is an extremely beneficial investment platform for those who are starting to invest in cryptocurrencies, which could somehow relate to the objectives of the challenge as it would facilitate investing in Ada; but it would also facilitate investment in Ethereum, Bitcoin and etc, other currencies, and I don't think it is our role to facilitate investment in a group of currencies, but in ours. For that reason, I don't think this proposal aligns so well with what we're looking for in the challenge. \n",

In the matter of the roadmap, we are presented with what would happen each quarter (from 2022, I believe), some activities are listed. However, the period of a quarter is well fulfilled. It would be better if they divided these tasks into months, for example. What would happen in month 1, 2, 3 and so on. It would also be necessary to better explain each activity, since all we are told would be what will happen, but not how. Individual details are not provided. For example, in Q3 and Q4, the following activities would be carried out: introduce the mobile Dapp and grow the customer base. Who would they introduce Dapp to? How would you make this presentation? Would it be an event, an intense week of publicity? By which platform? Would it all be online, or would something happen in person? How do they plan to expand this customer base? The target audience would be those who are starting to invest in crypto, I believe, but how are they going to get these people's attention and attract them, especially to our Cardano ecosystem? As well as these, the other activities could have been better explained. Regarding the division of money, it is also very superficial. They work with percentages: to build the main developer support team it would take 70% of the 25k budget, which is quite a lot. Who would get how much? And what is the main developer salary? For the marketing parties, what would the dissemination strategy look like? What, exactly, is content creation (this is pretty broad)? It would be better if bidders reported the exact salary of all the participants involved and how the rest would be distributed (they could link to the tasks in the script, for example - how much each would cost). And finally, when it comes to the team, the same thing happens, lack of details. Who is a blockchain developer? I would like to know a little about your professional curriculum, previous work, if you have an academic background and more importantly, how it relates to the Cardano ecosystem. As our community discovered and if we worked with our blockchain before, in addition to a way to verify the information said, some kind of online portfolio. In the same way, these details should have been provided about the other team members, designers, who will do operations (I would like to understand which ones, lacked conceptualization) and content writer. They don't specify if there will be someone on the marketing side, a specific professional for that.

The authors state that they will use agile software development methods, which will be responsible for accelerating the process and managing it. They also give other details, such as that they will focus on the “scrum” and so on. Unfortunately, this information seems to be a way of organizing and monitoring the project internally, that is, between team and project. But how to make this monitoring reach the rest of the community? How will people outside the development area understand the advances of this project, how can this information be brought to the public in a way that is accessible to all? In the following excerpt: “an open Scrum board will be made public so that all community members can check and track project progress in the Atlassian JIRA Tool”. What would scrum be, what tool is Atlassian Jira? How can lay people understand this? I think that in order to perform satisfactory auditability, it would be important that the team and some members of the Cardano community, more technical, who understand the technologies to be created here, come together and bring the information of the progress in a clear way for everyone. In my opinion, this would be the best way to monitor the project, as I don't think the general public would be able to follow such specific activities. The authors provide technical data that can be audited by a specialized team. In other words, it is a part of the walking path, but as I explained, I would like this understanding to be more accessible to everyone. It is possible to follow the progress of the project through the tasks that are part of the roadmap, even if they are not situated in time. And about the success, I found that part a bit abstract. The goal is, of course, to make investing in cryptocurrencies simpler, but we need to be more exact. What number of users is expected over time? Would any research be done to understand the impact of Dapp on these people's lives? How would this all reflect specifically on the Cardano ecosystem?

      "The proposal was very well summarized in the following topics: “To carry out a creative workshop within SOS-childvillages in Botswana”. This is the initial idea, the proponent intends to bring the art produced by a community of African children into the Cardano ecosystem. He would do this by transforming these arts into CNFTs, building a community on twitter and discord, and configuring the “wallets on the Cardano network. Create smart contracts that give a percentage to community creators in Botswana.” CNFTs would be launched on the market. I found the idea interesting, but this part of only a percentage of the profit going to the artists worried me, who would get the rest of the profit? I think it's a very interesting way to introduce this community to our blockchain technologies, which aligns with the goals of the challenge from the moment that both Africans would benefit (they would learn a new way of profiting from their art and could also get involved in the community in other ways); and Cardano, from the moment that new active members would be added to the community, which would generate popularization and greater investment in our blockchain. So I think the idea is good, it just needed a little more clarity on the part of the distribution of funds so that we understand the real impact for the African community in question. \n",

Regarding the budget, the total amount is divided into some parts, but I think it would be more interesting if there were more details regarding each of the expenses. For example the vectorization of the arts would cost 4 thousand dollars, but how many arts would be vectorized? And for how long would the professional involved perform this activity? It's not very clear. Finally, speaking of the team, it's actually just the proponent, which worries me, because in general projects with this level of complexity would be better developed with a multidisciplinary team, that is, with different people involved performing different functions. The details on the proponent are also not very extensive, we do not know, for example, how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem, so there is not so much confidence in their preparation to deal with our blockchain technologies.

The proponent does not make it clear how the information said here would reach the Cardano community, and this point is really very necessary to think about. Finally looking at the final results, I really found the information provided here to be too abstract. It is necessary that we think of more accurate ways of measuring success. This should be done both quantitatively - such as the number of CNFTs sold, how many artists remained involved with the project, how many people were added to the Cardano ecosystem - and qualitatively - how are these people getting involved in the community's activities? How was the target audience, that is, the children's community benefited? How can we ascertain the consequences of this idea both for Cardano and for Africa? I think, once again, that there is a lot to be improved in this part of the proposal.

      "This proposal is rather superficial as a whole. We do not know, exactly, which activities will be developed within this library. On the feasibility part, the proponent explains that personalities (from the cryptographic world, I believe, because it doesn't make much sense for them to be well-known people who are not from the blockchain field) will be hired to lecture on “matters of national interest”. What subjects would those be? How would the Cardano ecosystem benefit from these lectures and the other library activities? My understanding of this proposal is that the objective is to generate a more suitable place for school-aged students to concentrate and learn, but it is very inexact how this would all have to do with the cryptographic world, let alone Cardano. This challenge aims to fund projects that help expand our blockchain to more specific communities, unlike the challenge of new members on board. In this case, little is explained about the community that would be the target audience of this project. I researched a little about the Medie community, but I couldn't identify what country they are from, what language they speak, what their cultural characteristics would be. Another clue we have about where the people on this project would come from is through the professionals involved: it is revealed to us that Mr. John Kwame Afrane is an agent of fan milk Ghana ltd. With this, we concluded that the library would be built in that country, however, it was necessary for this information to be more accurate. Therefore, I consider that the impact of this proposal is, unfortunately, quite low, and could be improved with the following corrections. 1) The proponent should explain more about the activities carried out in that place, we know what their opening hours and target audience would be (although we know very superficially, as it is not given an exact age group that they would have or how many they would be). However, it is not clear how this would be a space for popularizing the Cardano ecosystem. 2) The proponent also needs to explain more about the local community so that we can understand how the proposal aligns with the specific challenge objectives. \n",

      "The feasibility of the proposal is quite average, as all the information we need to know is passed on in a superficial way. Starting with the roadmap, we know which activities would be necessary for the development of the project, but these activities are not explained in detail. Let's cite as an example the first thing that would need to be done: “raising awareness of the existence of libraries in the community”. How would this awareness be promoted? We are told that schools would be visited in person, but once the team was there, how would they explain to students, parents and teachers what space is and what are its objectives? Let's cite another example. “Registration of people to use the library” - how would this registration be done? Could it be that decentralized identities from the Atala Prism project would be used? Or would it be a manual registration, which would be registered in some team file? Would only students be registered, or would teachers and parents also be registered? All activities, in my view, should have been better explained. I also notice that the proponent does not associate the activities with any notion of time, that is, we do not know how long each of them would last, in which months of the year 2022 such things are expected to be completed, etc. As a result, I cannot clearly visualize the process. Now talking about the budget, I believe that this part is better than the script, because it is explained in which small parts the total asking amount would be used. Some of them would require more detail as well, such as the “professional fees for inviting personalities to a one-week program for each quarter within a 12-month period”. It is not said how many personalities would be hired, so we were not able to clearly visualize the individual hiring value to determine whether the value is fair or not. Finally, speaking of the team, unfortunately this part is quite incomplete. They are actually a duo, but little is known about them. We only know their names and what their professional functions are, but it would be necessary for us to know a series of details such as: resumes that exemplify some of their previous work, in order to understand in what exact fields they have experience; their linkedin profiles or even other platforms that could prove the information that was said; it would also be necessary for them to explain how they are involved with our ecosystem. How did you meet Cardano? Do you have any experience with our blockchain, and if so, what? For these reasons, I believe the feasibility isn't all bad, but it has a lot to improve. \n",

I agree that through these factors we can understand the partial success of the project, but it is not clear how all this information will reach the members of the Cardano community. Ideally, all this would be forwarded in a summarized and very practical way to us, and there are several ways to submit such indications, such as: online files through google docs, for example; tools like Miro and Notion; or through the telegram and discord channels of the community. I would also like to see a follow-up of the work routine of the professionals involved, but for that it would be necessary for them to specify precisely what the role of each of the pair would be. Now, talking about the final scenario, the auditability of this part is worse, as the expected results are very abstract: it is about students visiting the library frequently and also improving their school performance. But what about the Cardano ecosystem? How could we measure the ultimate impact of this project on our blockchain? After all, if the project is to be financed, it must bring some kind of advantage to Cardano. Therefore, it is essential that the proponent clarify how this relationship can be measured, perceived and informed. It should set goals related to this, such as how the library's activities specifically benefited our blockchain; for that, it would be necessary for us to know which themes were addressed in the speeches of the personalities. Also if the students who attend the library learned the basics about the cryptographic world, if this information was passed on to their families and if with that there was the popularization of Cardano. This popularization could be measured according to the increase in investment in Ada, creation of digital wallets, purchase of CNFT and much more. Once the proponent gathers these indicatives, they must be taken to the community through one of the platforms I mentioned earlier, in the partial results part. Finally, my opinion is that he was doing well with the auditing part of the process, but the level dropped a lot with the final results as nothing is mentioned regarding our blockchain, so the auditability needs to be reviewed. \n",

      "The proposal doesn't fit 100% for the challenge because it intends to translate an app that helps people buy Ada and delegate in pools to Thai, and Thailand is not exactly in the geographic region that we are targeting in this challenge. However, I think that if we are to think about Asia as a whole and the need to bring the technologies of the Cardano ecosystem to different areas and people, I still think it's worth funding it, especially since the app already exists so it wouldn't be something totally starting from the zero, and from what the proponent says it is well evaluated, that is, it would be a good business to expand it. Thailand is not an area where cryptographic activity is that intense, as far as I know, I apologize if I'm wrong, but I'm already in the community, I have 4 Catalyst funds and this is the first time I've evaluated any proposal aimed at that country . That's good and bad, I believe. It is good because we will be taking an application in the local language to territories that are not well supported in terms of knowledge about blockchain technologies, which can be a great boost for people to start taking an interest in the activity. It would be important, in my opinion, to include a small guide that talks about the main concepts of the cryptographic world in the application. Here's the suggestion: as soon as the person registered, an infographic would automatically appear on the screen that explained through images about what blockchain, Cardano, Ada, a pool and etc. are. Sometimes people go after these things because they think they will profit exponentially, but I believe that we all need to have a broader view of what Cardano is all about so that we can understand where we fit in in the community and how we can help blockchain, at the same time as investments and we managed to get some financial benefit out of it. If this little guide were inserted into the app, I believe it would be a good way (obviously it wouldn't teach anything beyond the basics, but it's a start). That said, I will give it four stars because, despite not being a country in East Asia, it is close and the more translations of Cardano-related content we finance, the better, in my opinion, since the language barrier is the main impediment to the mass expansion of the our blockchain. \n",

      "The auto claims that he already has 10 years of experience with the development of mobile applications and that some of them have millions of downloads, but it would be interesting for him to tell us more. For example, what apps are these? It would be amazing if he left the link for them on the play store / apple store, so that it was possible to know his work in practice. He'll do the development work, probably, it would be nice if he could tell us how that would go. And about the translator, I believe that finding a translator from English to Thai is not as fast as it is for languages ​​like Spanish and French, where many translators work with it. It is entirely possible to find someone who is qualified, but I would like to know about this selection process, or even better, if the bidder already has a few candidates in mind. It would be important to see previous examples of his work, that is, to analyze his resume, just to convey more confidence in the project team. Regarding the script, it would be nice if he had provided a schedule of how long this work would last, this would even help to audit the proposal, as I will talk about in the topic below. Anyway, without understanding how this work would be divided based on the passage of time, it is a little difficult to visualize the process. Even if it is a simpler task, where only two professionals would be involved, this notion of development would be interesting to have. And finally, as far as the budget is concerned, it is divided between the work of the developer and the translator, it is not complex, but a suggestion I can make is to determine the price of the hour of work - for that we would need to know how much How long would this translation take? For example, $1500 would go towards translation, right? But how long would that take, 1 week, 1 month? Depending on the time spent on this, we could have a better idea if the requested value was fair. In general, the feasibility of this proposal is good because of two factors: the author certainly knows what he is doing since he has a lot of previous experience and this would be an extension of something that already exists, and also because it is not a complex project . However, the suggestions I made could improve this part of the proposal even further, in my opinion, because details are never unnecessary. \n",

      "The auditability of the proposal is simple, the proposer indicates how we could monitor the success of the project based on the numbers of downloads of the application by speaking Thai, but I think he was wrong in the part that says that this audience is in Africa, because the Thailand is in Asia... right? Anyway, this is a pretty straightforward way to check if the main goal has been achieved, but I think we could do a little more analysis. Is it possible to measure the impact of this translation if we think about the more human aspects of the thing, for example, there was a survey in the app itself about whether these new users are able to understand the technologies of the Cardano ecosystem? Have they become interested in our blockchain to the point of doing other activities besides investing in Ada? For example, did they find out about Catalyst? Did they become CAs, bidders? Did they study about the cryptographic world, perhaps? That way, I think we would have a deeper understanding of the impact of translation on the selected target audience. But I also advise that we follow up on the translation process itself, if it is being done as promised, in the time it was planned, if the results of the process (not just the product) are within the limits. It would be positive if a Thai-speaking Cardano ecosystem member himself liaised with the project team (developer and translator) and brought feedback to the rest of the community. As in the previous topic about feasibility, I think this one is satisfactory, but I advise a further level of depth to understand the real impacts of translating this application on speakers of the language in question. \n",

      "I believe that this proposal partially meets the objectives of the challenge. It is a platform that, as I understand it, brings together several DAOs and each of them has a tab, on which those who click will see basic information such as the product being created, team values, areas that need new members, information about rewards, etc. These guides would also guide the way of people very accurately and able to track their digital wallets. About this, I do not know is such an interesting idea. Imagine that a person using this platform wants to know the DAOs there but without the commitment to get involved, without the desire to provide any personal data. Would the obligation to involve digital wallets not be a barrier for new participants? Anyway, I think the project meets part of what we asked for in the challenge, because it would be an incentive for those who already know Cardano and know what DAOs are and want to engage in one of them, but I don't think it's an accessible space for brand new members. In this way, the proposal aligns with the objective of increasing the engagement of current members of the Cardano community, but it would not be a gateway for new members, because I think that they would hardly find this site and if they did, they would probably not understand it. it, right? In any case, as it is an idea that can benefit the Cardano ecosystem, we must pay attention to it and conclude, through the analysis of all parties, whether it is viable for funding. \n",

      "There is no actual script here. We know that the plan is to create 18 DAOs, and what would be done for the development of each. This part is done with a good level of detail, we were able to understand clearly what would need to be done individually. The issue here is that this information is not organized in a timeline, that is, we do not know, for example: in which month of 2022 this project would start to be put into practice, if financed; how long it would take to fully create each DAO; how long each task needed to create them would take individually. If this was communicated along with the details of the process, we would have a good roadmap, as we would understand what was going to happen and also when. About budget division, 48k of funding is requested; the explanation of this money is made a little superficially, in my opinion, because we know that each DAO would cost on average 2000 USD (actually they give a price range, which is a little worrying, because what happens if a DAO comes out more expensive? Will you lack money for another one?). The understanding of the price of each DAO is satisfactory, what worries me is the additional 12k, it is a very high amount and it is not so clear what it would be used for. According to the proponent, this reservation would be “to create educational content related to topics like legal, tokenomics, etc. of DAOs”. But this information is passed in a little abstract way, I believe that if we had more details about it, the trust would be greater. How much would go to the legal part? What are tokenomics? If that money doesn't need to be used, where does it go? And finally, regarding the team, I think that unfortunately this part of the proposal leaves something to be desired. We know the names and roles of those involved in the project, but the information is superficial. A really detailed curriculum on any of them is not included, so we could see examples of their previous work in practice; we don't know how these people relate to the Cardano ecosystem, it is not said that none of them have experience with our blockchain technologies, and in my view it is essential to have at least one professional who is well-understood about everything that says about Cardano .

      "The project's auditability is good, but could improve in some aspects. I think it's very positive that they use Notion, an organization application that can be used for shared online work, and leave it to anyone who wants to consult everything that is recorded there. They also have a github repository where the community would be able to monitor the more technical parts of the project. The only thing that I think was lacking was a better defined script so that we could have more clarity than verifying if it was being done in the right way, at the right time and by the right people. If that were included, I would say that the tracking process would be perfect. Now going to the results, I think it is possible to analyze the success of the project, as the proponent says, by the development and unfolding of the 18 DAOS. As it is a fragmented project, one could say, two things would be interesting: both that the proponent maintains constant and periodic contact with the representative of each DAO, so that, for example, every month, we have individualized feedback from them, the more towards the end of the project, as the DAOs were advancing in their own projects, the results would be shared with the Cardano community itself. It would also be important that community members use the site, to check its ergonomics, that the guides created are really clear and are as promised. With that, I think it is possible to audit this proposal quite adequately. I will give it 4 stars because I think the proponent presents what is necessary for a satisfactory follow-up, but with a few more activities it could improve its quality. \n",

      "I liked the idea, but I identified serious problems here. Starting with the name of the project, which makes an analogy with the game Axie Infinity, which was a great boom in recent times, seen as a fun way to profit from cryptocurrencies and thus generate extra income. I don't think it's interesting for us to associate Cardano with the project of an Ethereum-based game, I don't think that would be done with good eyes. The impression that gives me is that we would be trying to take advantage of the fame achieved by this other project in the cryptographic world, when in reality I think it's better that we create our own identity, our mark on the world. The idea itself is a good one, it consists of learning about math in a fun and engaging way while getting rewards in cryptocurrencies. However, this idea should have been better explained. What would the game be like in practice? Why would it be built especially for an African audience? Would it be available in native mainland languages? What would be the teaching methodology? How would the games be? Would it be an online game? How could we prove that players actually learned math and the other things the game seeks to teach? What would the rewards be like? Would the player have to make an initial investment, as in the case of Axie Infinity? There are many doubts that remain, and I cannot see clearly how this proposal could benefit the African continent (since it is not explained how the game would be aimed at this audience) and also help to expand the Cardano ecosystem (by fact that the idea is not well explained, we do not know which technologies of our blockchain would be present here and etc). Anyway, in general, I think the intention is good and can be quite profitable, but in practice I am not sure about the impact of this proposal, due to the questions raised so far. \n",

      "The viability of the game is very low, unfortunately. Starting with the fact that we don't have a script. We only have the goals to be achieved annually. Most of the proposals that I have evaluated so far in this fund measure the temporality of their timelines by quarter, which I already thought was a very long time. Who will say for years... I would like at least the year 2022 to be well detailed. We know the goal is to “design and implement the project framework for deliverables”, but what tasks are required to achieve this? It would be necessary for the proponent to explain what would be done monthly, which steps would be carried out, detailing how the design and implementation of the game would take place. Unfortunately, the script is too abstract, not allowing us to have a reasonable view of the process. Regarding the budget, the amount requested, according to the proponent, would be enough just to start the game, this is very worrying because we don't know what its total value would be, for example. It would also be necessary for him to detail how the 33k would be used, in which parts it would be divided, how much each professional involved in the project would earn, in short, why do we need this amount to start this project? Unfortunately, we also cannot believe if the funding requested is fair and compatible with the project, because we hardly know what is to come and we also don't know how this money would be subdivided and used. And finally, we are not introduced to any team, we are told that here would be an initial team that would later partner with the WADA group, already famous here at Catalyst for promoting proposals in the Africa challenge, always present in the background. We would need to know exactly who these people are, their names, a brief resume of what they have done so far, how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem, their roles in the project, their linkedin profiles... In this way, we would have a solid knowledge about who we're dealing with. So, I'm going to give the minimum grade for the feasibility of this proposal, because there is no well-planned roadmap, there is no explanation of the budget and there is no presentation from the team, the things we would need to understand in this topic. \n",

      "According to the proponent, progress will be measured by “the number of daily participants at all community meeting points”. What meeting points are these? I think that this statistic is not enough to accurately measure whether the project development process is adequate. We would first need to have a roadmap, and based on it, establish direct contact with the team and verify that each phase was being carried out as planned. If the work routines were being fulfilled and if the partial results were being achieved. Regarding the final goal, the proponent says that the plan is to have millions of young people playing ADAxie Eternity, however, this goal is quite ambitious and difficult to measure. It would be interesting to think about aspects closer to us, such as if the game has brought new members to the Cardano community, if it is in fact bringing a new source of income to Africans, if it is helping them to learn mathematics, so if the education is improving organically in the chosen location... Anyway, I think it would be necessary for us to elaborate more tangible goals, let's say, than the idea of ​​having millions of players. That may even happen, but until then, we have small achievements to measure as well. It is necessary for the Cardano community to have contact with the game's team, through video calls, online platforms such as Notion, Miro or google docs, for example, in short, some way to establish this bridge. In this way, I believe that the auditability of the game would be much better done, I consider that the monitoring suggested by the proponent is superficial and does not meet well what we would need to know, both in terms of auditing the process and the final results. \n",

      "The idea is to distribute CNFTs for free, according to the proponent, this will attract new members to the Cardano ecosystem, as according to them people love to receive free stuff and will open a digital wallet for that. I disagree that this is a good way to attract active members to the Cardano ecosystem, and I will do a comparison to explain my point of view. When people open online stores on Instagram, for example, they often hold sweepstakes to attract new followers. These people who participate in the sweepstakes will certainly follow the profile and rules that have been established so that participation can be valid. However, right after the draw, winning or losing, people tend to unfollow that profile, because the interest was never in the content/products advertised there, but in obtaining a certain product or service for free. I think this thought makes sense for this very case. People can even open their digital wallets, but in my opinion they would only be interested in making a profit, or they would sell the CNFTs received at the same time, or at most they would wait for them to appreciate, in order to profit even more. The chances of these people getting really involved with Cardano, that is, studying our blockchain, its features and advantages, buying and delegating Ada, participating in Catalyst, seeking to invest in ecosystem Dapps and using its technologies in practice, would be minimal. It is much more likely that they just want to make a profit and have no further interest in understanding and delving deeper into Cardano. So I don't think this is a smart way to attract active members (emphasis here!) to our community, it will most likely attract those looking for quick and easy profit. \n",

      "No roadmap is attached to the proposal. What is said about the development process is that “The team members and I will systematically hunt for new users and onboard them by offering free CNFT”. But how would that be done? We know that the whole process would take 4 months, but we have no idea 1) where the proponent and their working partners would go to look for these people 2) what criteria would be used to select who would receive the CNFTs 3) how follow-up would be done of the selected people, in order to understand how they would be using the benefit that was granted to them and if they are somehow integrating the Cardano ecosystem. So, in relation to the roadmap, I think the proposal doesn't make it clear how this process would be done, what is passed is just an idea of ​​what would be worked on after the funding, without a detail that allows the proposal's readers to visualize in a way solid work to come. Regarding the budget, all the money that is requested would be used in two parts: purchase of the CNFTs and time spent by the proponent when he was dedicated to this work. I think the monetary explanation is not good, for example these two parts: “$3750 = Buy highly desirable popular Cardano NFTs to include in Giveaway / $1000 = to make and purchase additional CNFTs to be given away in the initial 2500”. There is not a considerable difference between them, in my opinion, as one corresponds to the first CNFT purchases followed by later investment. I also think the asking price is quite high for something that is so poorly explained, so I also think that part of the proposal is inadequate. Regarding the analysis of the team, it is not shown who the members of this team are, we do not know the basic information that says about them. For this part to be adequate, it would be necessary for us to know the full names of all those involved, what their areas of professional training, what their previous experiences were (and that this was proven through, for example, a linkedin profile) and in what way they relate to the Cardano ecosystem. Without such information, it is really impossible to trust a team that we do not know. So, unfortunately, I think all parts of this proposal deserved a revamp, both the script and the budget explanation and team presentation.

      "The project is not auditable because at no time does the proponent indicate how he will perceive if the project has indeed positively impacted the Cardano ecosystem. He says that “I can have a dedicated wallet that will track how many CNFTz have been donated”, which would be a way for us to understand where the CNFTs used in the project ended up, but it is not a concrete way for us to assess the development as a whole. As the project would last 4 months, the proponent should, at the end of each month, inform the Cardano community what progress he made in that period of time, which includes understanding how many people he donated the CNFTs to and also how these people were selected. Such information must arrive in a simple and accessible way to the members of our ecosystem, so that we can follow all updates. As the information is very succinct, I think it would be interesting to create an online document (it could be through google docs) in which all people with the link could have access. The tenderer could post all monthly information there. And in relation to the final results, it is necessary for us to understand if in fact the main objective of this project was achieved, which would be precisely to understand if new members were added to the Cardano community and how these people would be relating to our blockchain. In my view, the most appropriate way to do this is through a direct survey with those involved in the project: everyone who received the CNFTs should, after some time spent in the project, answer some questions such as: “how are you relating to the project? with Cardano? Did you research more on the subject? Invested in Ada? Have you acquired other CNFTs?” and etc. In this way, we could understand whether the people in question really became active members or were just looking to profit from the situation. If they don't answer the form, which is a possibility, we can consider this, that their positioning was only to sell to momentarily profit from the thing and they didn't actually become active members of the community. So I think the proposer doesn't give us good ways to audit the proposal, the suggestions I made could do that role, but this information should have been provided directly by the author of the proposal. \n",

      "The impact of this project is not very clear, and therefore I am not sure that it will align well with the objectives of the challenge. Here, we are seeking to finance audiovisual projects that go beyond youtube, where Cardano already has a strong base of content and viewers, products that pierce the bubble in which we find ourselves and dialogue with traditional media and different types of audiences. With this, we aim to increase the reach of our blockchain, so that more people know Cardano, understand at least the basics about its technologies and who knows, become active members of the community, acquiring Ada, delegating them to one of our pools, etc. From what I understand the objective of this film would be to break the prejudice with Cardano, as the author says in the first sentence of this proposal, “there is a lot of FUD against crypto/Cardano ADA”. What is FUD? Well, from the context I infer that it is really misinformation, prejudice and misconceptions, such as that all NFTs are coined in an anti-ecological way (we know that the way they are processed at Cardano has one of its ideas being ecological, so it doesn't consume as much energy and cause deforestation as people think all blockchains do). Anyway, that would be the goal of the film, and with that it would disseminate instructions about our ecosystem, which would fulfill the objectives of the challenge. The problem is that from the description of the proposal we have no guarantee of how this would be done. The author claims that people knowledgeable in the audiovisual field read and approved his script. But it would be much better, instead of saying that, if he made this script available, so that we could: understand the story, what would be the beginning, middle and end? Is it a traditional narrative? He said it would be cult, but why? And why that would be good, if our goal is to reach the masses with narrations that are interesting and compatible with the widest possible audience. I would also like to know the characters, the climax of the story, and especially, at what point Cardano would enter this narrative and in what way. How our blockchain would be presented to the public, what concepts would be covered within the various that people need to know to understand the Cardano ecosystem (from the most basic things like what is blockchain, cryptocurrencies, a pool and etc to the more complex ones). What kind of narration would this film have (direct or indirect)? Anyway, we were not able to understand exactly the characteristics of the story, in cinema we have a maxim that is \"don't talk, show\" (when it comes to making the scenes happen in the movies) I think this would also fit the case of the proposals for this challenge. It would also be interesting if he attached a trailer. Anyway, I didn't feel sure how this film would impact the Cardano ecosystem and if it would be in line with the specific objectives of the challenge, because in my view there was a lack of information, we only have a synopsis of the film in the auditability, but that doesn't fill the gap of things we need to know. \n",

      "The roadmap is shallow, the proponent says that more details will be given if the proposal is funded, but unfortunately this is not how it works, in order for it to be funded we need to fully understand what will be done, how and if it will achieve the objectives of the challenge. The script is an indispensable part of understanding the whole, because through it the idea is to solidly visualize the process; what would be needed here is for each of these phases (Q1, Q2 and so on) to be better explained. It would be necessary for the tasks that would compose them to be informed and detailed, I'll give an example: at first, the fundraising and agreements would be finalized. What agreements? With whom, for what purposes? In Q2 the filming would take place, in this part we would need to know: 1) where the filming would take place 2) the filming plan that included what would be shot each day, which scenes, locations, actors, audiovisual professionals and etc 3) the exact dates , to understand how long we are thinking of working. And likewise, the other steps should be better detailed as well. Regarding the budget, 50k is requested, but note that this money would not cover all the expenses of the film, marketing, for example, does not enter these accounts. I didn't understand for sure if this part would be their internal funding (the professionals themselves would pay) or if the money would be raised in another way other than through Catalyst, for example. Regarding the explanation of how these 50k would be used, the proponent makes a division by means of %, for example 10% ie 5k would go to the director. I can't see if it's a fair value because we don't know how many hours of work each professional would have, so it's not possible to trace the relationship between hours of work and price, so I don't know if the value is fair or above the necessary/compatible with the Marketplace. Some expenses, such as “miscellaneous”, could be explained. What do they think could happen unexpectedly so that 5% of the budget was reserved for this? Finally, as far as the team is concerned, I don't think that part is explained satisfactorily. The only person with a very detailed resume is screenwriter Dennis Posadas, he is also the only one who seems to have any knowledge of Cardano. But what knowledge is this? What is your relationship, exactly, with our blockchain? Is he an active member of the community, if so in what way? In this specific challenge, I think it's important to have a balance, logically most of the team will be from the audiovisual area, but it's essential that we have a Cardano specialist to ensure that information about our ecosystem is correctly represented. \n",

      "I don't think the proposal is highly auditable because the proposer talks about few ways for us to track the progress of this film. He says that there will be quarterly updates on Cardano's foundation, what do you mean? What will be updated, and why only quarterly? Monthly feedback would be more appropriate, I think that 3 months is too long for us to be unaware of the progress of the project. There is also no clarity on how these updates would be transmitted, if it would be through video calls, written reports, infographics... They claim they will also make the film outline available, but I think this is something that needed to be delivered now. , in the proposal itself. It would be a lot easier to monitor the project if it had a detailed schedule, some member of the Cardano community who lived where the movie was going to be filmed (or at least most of the scenes) who from what you can tell, in the Philippines, could follow the project more closely and bring periodic feedback to the Cardano community. It would be even more interesting if that person understood something about audiovisual. Anyway, everything I mentioned so far would be a means of following the process, but we also need to stay in the results. In relation to this, some very abstract expectations are also given. For example, when the movie would be finished and also that some big streaming service like Netflix or HBO is expected to show it, and that millions of viewers are expected. These are all goals, I would say, a bit generic. I would like to understand more. For example, which film festivals does the team intend to submit the film to? If no streaming service accepted to show the project, what would be the alternative? The house of millions of viewers is an ambitious goal, how do they intend for the film to become so popular? We would need to know the marketing strategies to be more confident that this goal would be achieved. Finally, there was a lack of detail, outlining more tangible goals and strategies on how to achieve them, in addition to that they only mention goals about the reach of the film - it would also be important to understand if the spectators caught the message and were interested in Cardano, going after more informations about. It could be measured, for example, the reaction of the public through social media and it would also need to be observed if, by chance, at the time of the film's exhibition, the number of google searches related to Cardano increased, bought more Adas and etc, ways to measure the direct impact of this production on our blockchain. Therefore, I think the auditability is insufficient. \n",

      "The proposal aims to translate an existing app into the Burmese language, mainly spoken by my research in Myanmar. This country is not located exactly in the geographic region targeted by the challenge, therefore, it will not specifically help to develop it, as is our objective here. It is a country close to Thailand; according to the author, about 50 million people speak this language. It would be interesting, however, to present the source of this information, some statistics that can prove the proponent's words, I believe that's it, but as it is a language a little less known by the general public, I think it would be important to have the source of this research. Other than that, I think it's a project that has everything to work out, due to the fact that the author already has the app, so it would be an extension of it, expanding it to new audiences and democratizing knowledge about how to acquire Ada and delegate them in a pool. Myanmar is really a country I don't know so I can't say how strong the crypto community is there, but it would be nice if the proponent included a basic guide on what Cardano is all about when users log into the app. This could introduce the subject if someone happens to download the app out of curiosity (I don't think that will be the case, but it's always good to be on guard). This guide could explain initial concepts like what is blockchain, Ada, Cardano, a pool and etc. Finally, although the country and language in focus here are not exactly what we are looking for in the challenge (favoring East Asian countries, educating their residents about Cardano ecosystem technologies, thus favoring people and blockchain at the same time) it is still a very positive proposal that could help the ecosystem to expand. I will give 3 stars because 1) Myanmar is not the target of the challenge 2) I would like some extra information about this country/language. \n",

      "The author is certainly well prepared to run this project successfully, because he already has some successful apps, according to him. It would be even better if he made available in the proposal links through which we could see these apps in the play store / apple store, so we would see in practice proof of his work. He could have included more information about himself here, such as his professional background (he is a developer, but what kind of developer? What is his connection with the Cardano ecosystem?) and what was the process of creating the application in question, which will be translated into Burmese. Now let's talk about the translator: as it is a less widespread language, it will be important to find a qualified professional, preferably a native of Myanmar, to do this translation work. Due to the specificity of the language, I would like the tenderer to present us with some candidates for the job, in order to verify if this person would be qualified for it. It would be important for us to know a little about his curriculum, in addition to the translation itself, would this person have any knowledge about the Cardano ecosystem? Regarding the script, the proponent did not include a timeline through which we could understand the development process of this project, whether through weeks, months, etc. It's a simple task, I see that he has launched several proposals to translate his application into different languages, but I would like to understand exactly how the work routine of the professionals involved would be. This would give us more clarity regarding the visualization of the process. And about the budget, it is a small amount in relation to the funding requested in the other proposals, but as I mentioned in the other cases of translation of this application, it would be important to know the total time that the developer and the translator would be working on it, that way we could calculate the hourly rate of work or monitor whether the asking price is fair. In general, the author provides us with the necessary information to understand what would happen, all that was needed was to better explain how it would happen and who, in essence, are the people who would work here? \n",

      "As in the other proposals by this author to translate his app, he points out numerical data that serve to measure the success of the project, which is important and necessary. But auditability can go further, there are more humane ways, let's say, of analyzing whether the project is achieving the desired impact. As I also suggest for other translations, a user survey could be carried out to understand whether Burmese speakers, in addition to being supported in the issue of purchasing and delegating Ada, would be interested in other technologies of the Cardano ecosystem. If so, would they be able to understand about, for example, Catalyst, how to participate, where they fit in, etc? I think it would be important to establish some kind of contact with this audience. This research can be done through the application itself or, also, another idea I had: contact them via email, some time later, in order to establish this bridge. They will be supported by the application and from this input we can understand if they would in fact be entering the cryptographic world, but specifically Cardano. The translation process would also need to be analyzed, we would need to verify that the work was being developed as promised, this can be done through a member of the Cardano community, a native of Myanmar. This person could stay in touch with the team and provide sporadic feedback to the rest of the Cardano community, as well as review the final product, ie the translated app. Anyway, there is a possibility of auditing this proposal, even if we can go further with this monitoring. \n",

      "Unfortunately, I don't find this proposal interesting to benefit from and I disagree that it will have a high impact on the Cardano ecosystem. The idea is to create a “Ziwwe platform” where people can transfer money quickly and conveniently to each other. However, in my view, this is already what we do with our digital wallets (whether yoroic, ccvaultio, etc, wallets that work with Cardano); Blockchain transactions already have this characteristic of being simple and fast, this already happens, it is already an existing technology. Another problem that I identified here was that the proponent claims that the idea is to transfer a stable currency, but Cardano does not have this, as he claims. So in my view it doesn't make sense that a project is created to work with something that doesn't yet exist in our ecosystem. I think the proponent is not suggesting something innovative, something that will help Cardano become popular and widely adopted. Therefore, I think that this proposal would be more interesting in case it suggests solutions to improve a situation that already exists (for example, transfers in digital wallets) or could propose new solutions that meet the needs of the members of the Cardano ecosystem and attract new people to our community. Regarding the impact, I really felt that this proposal does not meet the objectives of the challenge and leaves a lot to be desired. \n",

      "I found the script of this proposal rather vague. We are told that activities would develop according to the quarters of the years 2022 and 2023. However, the explanations are very superficial. For example, the first quarter of this year would be an “Ideation Phase, Market Research, Proposal Submission”. The proponent could have detailed this much better, what will this idealization look like? Who will work on it and doing what? What exactly will he be looking for during his market research? To whom would he present the proposals? The same thing I think for the second quarter of this year: “Finish the Software Requirements Document”. How would this finalization be done, in what form is the document expected to be so that it can be presented? Now, analyzing the requested budget, 80 thousand dollars are requested, a very high amount. I believe that the value would be justifiable with the complexity of this project, however the budget explanations should also be better detailed. Let's take the third quarter of this year as an example. The following activities would be carried out: “Finish POC (Mobile Application - iOS/Android) + Growth - Publications/Reach/Marketing to grow Remitter Network + MRP v1 Development”, with a cost of $10,000. How much would each of these parts cost? I'm concerned that the proponent reserves 10 to 20 thousand dollars for miscellaneous expenses, but if that is not necessary, for example if the expense is 10 thousand dollars, what would happen to the other 10 thousand? Finally, analyzing the team, it is actually just one person, the proposer. We know the role of Tochi Eke-Okoro and its linkedin, however, it is not presenting a curriculum, we do not know how it relates to the Cardano ecosystem. It would be important to have this information, in addition to what I think is inappropriate for this type of project to be developed by a single person; in my opinion, the team should also contain a designer to interface the Dapp and a publicist to generate a strong and appropriate marketing campaign. For these reasons, I think the feasibility of the proposal is low, in need of improvement. \n",

      "The bidder provides us with 4 points that would serve to audit the process - increase in local senders signing up or registering on the Ziwwe platform to support remittances + successful transaction percentage + TVL increase rate for loans and loans + liquidity increase. However, two important things are missing here. The first would be that: how would the Cardano community become aware of such statistics? Would the standard meetings with IOG coordinators take place, and after that, would this content also be made available to all members of the ecosystem, whether through telegram, discord, any online platform like Notion, Miro? And the other thing that I am concerned about is in relation to monitoring the work of the proponent, we know that the project would last about 2 years, it is a very long time, it would be necessary that some measurable ways to monitor the tasks that are behind the partial results were possible. The proponent, in my view, should prepare quarterly reports (preferably monthly, but as he divides his time into quarters, it could also be done) in a way that would update the entire community on the small advances of this project, as was his work routine, if problems had to be solved and so on. Regarding the final results, the proponent summarizes the objectives of the application being able to promote the fast and safe transfer of a stablecoin (he does not mention the stablecoin at this point in the proposal, but I infer that this is it); this would depend on the adoption of this platform by different audiences, and also on the growth of the community that the proponent already has on discord. I found this scenario very abstract, not saying about the Cardano ecosystem. It would be essential for us to know directly what the consequences of this project were for our blockchain, how it contributed to its wide adoption, if more people started making transactions on Cardano, etc. Therefore, I also found this topic inappropriate, in need of improvement. The part that I thought was better is the auditability of the process, but the final results are still very vague. \n",

      "I believe the idea is good, but it is still explained in a somewhat confusing way. In general, the ALMAGUA group wants to promote carbon offsetting (that is, the amount of pollutants that were generated will be rewarded with a way to clean the atmosphere, as I understand it), both for people and institutions. The argument of the problem situation is that this type of process is done on the Ethereum network and in itself already generates a lot of pollution, which is a fact, and Cardano would be a much more suitable blockchain for these NFTs to be minted and cleaning process atmosphere takes place. As I understand it, people/companies would purchase a CO2 removal voucher, and trees would be planted. Each voucher would generate an NFT. Some parts of the proposal are quite confusing, such as the following explanation: “ALMAGUA will collect data from solar-powered fishing boats and conservation of mature trees through the collective adoption of NFT trees. For each tree adopted, the non-fungible NFT token is received on the cardano blockchain”; what fishing boats will these be? How do they relate to the trees that will be planted? I concluded that trees would be planted because of the passage “in the processes of measuring the footprint in forest conservation or planting cataloged species, we want to implement an Environmental and Economic Accounting System to legitimize the records in the carbon offset markets (...) ”. In this case, it is not so clear whether these trees would be planted or whether they are specimens that already exist but are being adopted, sponsored. It's all a little unclear. I think the proposal relates well to the challenge as it doesn't really fit the scope of any other challenge in the present fund; perhaps if the application were better specified it could fit the challenge of the Dapps or the National Building Dapps, if it were specified in which country this project would be developed and how the local community would benefit. As for whether this would benefit Cardano or not, I believe so because of the NFTs that would be generated and processed on Cardano's network (hence, they would be CNFTs), however, I really wish that part of the proposal had been clearer. With that, I conclude that: it's a good idea, it's not so well explained and it's not so clear how it could have measurable consequences for our blockchain, so my opinion on the impact will be neutral. \n",

      "Several activities are reported, such as “Creating nft for tree adoption”, “Testing the prototype of the solar boat and the smart meter (...)”, “Creating NFTs with Carbon Neutral Certification (...)” and etc. . According to what is said, all these activities would be developed during that year, being delivered in 2023 when DAO would begin to be created. I think the schedule is even satisfactory in terms of being informed about what would happen, the activities are well explained, the level of detail is sufficient for us to understand well what is to come. The problem here is the timing issue, I think it's inappropriate for proponents to just leave these tasks assigned for the whole year. It would be important for us to know what is planned for each month, so we would have a much more accurate view of the process. That is, the script is just ok, it's not the way it should. The budget explanation is superficial, in my opinion, because the total amount is divided into parts that are not explained. For example, “-$Amazon AWS 1500 USD x year”, what is that, and why would it cost 1500 USD per year? “- $1,535 USD Facebook Ads”, how many ads would there be, and who would create them? How often would they be released? I think all parts of the budget needed a more precise explanation, especially the “-$Structure Development-15,000” part, which would cost the largest portion of the total amount. I believe that here are the salaries of the professionals involved, so I think it would be interesting for us to know what their work routines would be like, daily hours dedicated to the project and so on. Speaking of them, the professionals involved, are given very little information about the team members. We only know their names, what professional role they play and also linkedin profiles. It is not explained in detail what they have done so far in their professional lives and how they interact with the Cardano ecosystem. Therefore, I think that the feasibility of the proposal is not good, all topics (script, team and budget) should be better developed; especially the last two. \n",

      "The auditability of the proposal is average in terms of the process. I think this is because the proponents tell us ways to monitor the process - for example, the budget will be present in an open book, they also indicate an estimate of how long the application prototype will be developed and so on. I think the amount of measurable information is satisfactory, but what I think was pending was: 1) to explain more directly how the community would have access to such information 2) to determine shorter delivery times, for example, lower than 6 months mentioned, it would be interesting to have more specific metrics than a semester 3) I would also like to be informed of some way to follow the daily work of the professionals involved, that is, what would be behind the partial results delivered. Turning now to the final results, I think that this part left a lot more to be desired than the previous one, since all the proponents claim as a success scenario would be “the development of the prototype to be able to measure and certify credits”. is quite abstract information, I would like more objective and specific ways to understand if the application was successful, and if the expected environmental impacts were achieved as well as the benefit of the Cardano ecosystem. It would be necessary for the team to carry out a study, to understand how the users of this application would be contributing to improve the atmospheric scenario, if the desired CO2 offset actually happened; and regarding Cardano, it would also be essential to have well-defined ways of measuring the consequences of this project for our blockchain. How to verify if those involved have become active members of the community? Somehow, they started to relate more directly with the technologies gies of our blockchain, such as our currency, other NFTs, have they created digital wallets or switched to using other Dapps? Anyway, it is very unclear how success would be reflected for Cardano, which in my view is the main metric that we should consider. So I think the feasibility of the process was going well but in the final scenario part the situation leaves a lot to be desired. \n",

      "The idea is theoretically quite aligned with the objectives of the challenge, but in practice this is not so clear. In theory, the Checkpoint platform would aim (according to the proponents) to allow users to access their digital assets, which includes NFTs (I don't know what else would be included, it would be interesting to clarify this) in wallets integrated with content of different blockchains. Users would be able to view and share their assets as long as the blockchain in question is supported by the shared digital wallets. The idea is to work with cross-chains, allowing an exchange of experience between Cardano, his names, and the other members of other cryptographic communities. This is very much in line with the specific objectives of the challenge, such as they are mentioned in the scope of explanation present in ideascale; in my view, several required topics would be covered, such as: the number of technical implementations capable of connecting Cardano with other blockchains; ideas from other chains implemented by Catalysy and project and Dapps from other chains implemented in Cardano. This can be seen from the moment that the core of this idea is to maintain an explicitly direct bridge with other blockchains. However, this is very theoretical, the proponents do not explicitly explain how this apparently very complex technology could actually be built. Due to the lack of direct explanations of how the project would be developed, I really can't be completely sure that the intentions (which are great) will be achieved. As much as the roadmap should be presented only in the topic below, on feasibility, it is always necessary for proponents to explain very clearly how the idea would leave the theoretical field for practice, that is, which parts would constitute the whole; which phases would need to be developed for the final product to be delivered; which professionals would be working here; metrics called “deliverables”, which can tell us what needs to be done, when, how and by whom; so that we then have a solid view of the project creation. In other words, even though the idea is fully aligned with what we are looking for specifically here, I don't feel safe to give a good rating for the impact of the proposal. If the proponents had attached the explanations that I cited, this would certainly be different, because in addition to understanding what would have to be done, we would know how it would happen and with that we would have more confidence as to the impacts that the project would generate for the Cardano ecosystem. So, I think it is necessary for the proponents to reformulate the presentation of the idea, specifying better the commented issues. \n",

It would be essential for proponents to detail each of these activities in good detail, the way they are presented, we only have a notion of what would be done, not a solid understanding of how this would be possible. The same thing I said about impact, it is not enough to inform what the objective is, and without how it will be achieved through small tasks that will be completed in a progressive way. A certain part of the proposal arrives where the proponents explain how the sharing of the NFTs would be (in “Initially, Checkpoint will offer commercial NFT cards. These cards will be released as albums, consisting of 20 cards per album, each with a unique design, etc etc. ...). I found this explanation great and super necessary for us to understand more clearly what would happen in the day-to-day usability of the platform. However, this still does not clarify how its construction process would have to be done in detail. In other words, this part of the proposal is inadequate, requiring better detailing. Moving on now to the budget analysis: this part is also very superficial. We know that the total funding is split into 3 parts and how much would go towards each (Smart Contract Creation - $25,000 + Marketing - $5,000 + Contingency - $2,000 USD). However, there is no detail on each of these parts. For example, in smart contract, which professionals would work here? For how many months? For how many days a week, totaling how many hours? What would the hourly rate be? What is the justification for the 25 thousand dollars? The marketing part should also be better explained, we don't know which marketing strategy will be adopted, so we don't know if the asking value is fair or abusive. Will there be a social media campaign? More traditional media? How will members of different cryptographic communities become aware of this project? And about the last expense: what is a contingency fee? Why does it cost 2 thousand dollars? I can't clearly understand how the money would be used, too much detail is talking. Finally, analyzing the team involved in the project, this part is much better. We know the names and a very rich curriculum of each team member, so we understand a little about their careers and what areas they work in. Two things worry me, however: the fact that no one attaches linkedin profiles or provides some résumé by which we can verify everything they say and also no one seems to be an expert in Cardano; How can we ensure that they are technically prepared to handle our blockchain technologies? In general, the feasibility is low, especially the first two topics should be much better explained. \n",

      "There is no way to monitor the process. Proponents already explain auditability by turning to the end results, that is, how the application could be considered properly constructed and successful. This would be understood by the number of people using cross digital wallets, amount of tokens traded, rewards received for mitigated content; and also, when the application is self-sustaining, that is, when the marketing costs were all supported by the generated revenue. In fact, these are good ways to understand if what was created got where it was expected to go, but there are many things that are pending here. Let's start with the first part that should be supervised: the process. How could project development be measured? What measurable metrics would be adopted? What quantitative and qualitative data would need to be constantly monitored? How could we ascertain whether the work routines of professionals were being followed and respected? It is essential that the script, first, be better detailed. With that, we would be able to have good material to serve as a basis for monitoring. In the second instance, the proponents should update at least monthly the IOG coordinators and the members of the Cardano community on the partial results, the small advances. It would be necessary for some contact to be established, whether via discord, telegram, gitbug, video calls and etc. Really, the platform is the least. The most important thing is to ensure that all content that needs to be monitored is actually monitored and that this is done at the correct frequency. Turning now to the success scenario, the proponents focus only on the direct results of their application, not thinking about verifiable ways to see how this all affected Cardano. Has the objective of this challenge, that a good exchange between our blockchain and the others be made, been achieved? How can we see better engagement of our community members from this project? Did the number of Ada and CNFTs in circulation grow from this idea? How to measure, prove it? I think that, unfortunately, auditability leaves a lot to be desired, several necessary things would not be analyzed according to what is being informed to us, requiring a reformulation of this part of the proposal. \n",

      "The idea is not bad, but unfortunately it is a little poorly structured. We know in general what would be done here, the purpose of the proposal is to create a platform that serves as a space for people with ideas, developers and Cardano enthusiasts to share ideas and develop projects from start to finish. The problem raised by the proponent is that “the proposals are too many good random ideas with communication and execution problems”. That is, as much as people have good ideas, they don't have constant and secure communication with each other, so they can't formulate proposals that are strong to be funded on Catalyst; from what I understand, the purpose of this platform would also be to connect different types of people, who can help each other. For example: I have a good idea, but I don't know anything about programming and development. Some programmer or developer may have the technical knowledge to make my idea a reality, but we don't have a communication bridge. I thought that overall the explanation of what this platform would be a little confusing, but that's what I inferred from the whole. The proponent explains which parts this platform would be formed by (Idea 360 Farm + idea 360 + Milestone 360), however, the explanation of these parts is a little superficial, it is not possible to understand exactly how each of them would be. Speaking of the objectives of the challenge, in particular, I disagree that the proposal fits well with what we are looking for, because it is not explained how this platform would be aimed at the Indian audience. At the end of the impact, the proponent states that “This project will focus on bringing some of the biggest developers in India and around the world into the Cardano development ecosystem”. However, how will this be done? How will these developers find out about the platform? How does the platform dialogue with the specificities of this people? Would it be in their native language? It is not clear why this platform is beneficial especially for India, the way the idea is presented seems to me to be a good way to promote communication among the general public of the Cardano community, but that is not what we are looking for in this challenge. It would be necessary for the proponent to better argue this point, after all the proposals that are financed in this challenge should benefit not only Cardano, but also India. \n",

      "The script of the proposal is unfortunately very superficial. All the activities that will be done are explained in a basic way, let's exemplify. The proponent states that it will “train 2 developers as training managers 6 weeks”. How will this training be done? What kind of learning will they have? What would happen in each training week? The proponent then says that each part of the platform (Idea 360 Farm + idea 360 + Milestone 360) would take approximately 1 month to build. However, it would be necessary for him to explain better what would happen in these time intervals, for example: who would perform what tasks, in the weeks of these months, what are the exact plans, what small goals should be achieved in these periods of time, how would it be the final delivery of those parts of the platform and etc. From the way the roadmap is explained to us, we do not have an exact view of the development process of this proposal. Now, speaking of financing, 29 thousand dollars are requested, a very high amount. I don't think the bidder adequately explained how this amount would be used, as again the information provided is superficial. He breaks the whole into a few parts, but doesn't argue why they need to cost what they do. For example, “Developer 360 Certification - $8,000”, what certification is this, and why does it cost $8,000? “idea 360 - $12,000 full-time project manager”, what would the project manager do in their work routine to justify this salary? Would he be active to the fullest extent of the proposal? Finally, speaking of the team, this part is not good either. It is revealed to us that the team would actually be a duo, “2 instructor managers (developers to manage the training certification program)”. However, it would be essential that more information be passed on about each of them. For example: their full names, their background, examples of previous work (a brief CV), how these people relate to the Cardano ecosystem (if they are active members and what they do). Unfortunately, confidence is not given in any of the fundamental parts of feasibility - roadmap, budget and staff, and a rephrasing of this part of the proposal is necessary. \n",

      "Regarding the auditability of the process, unfortunately the proponent only repeats the information that was given in the part of the script. It does not outline new ways in which we could monitor the project, it does not provide KPIs, metrics, what would be the partial results that would need to be achieved little by little for the proposal to be considered a success... For this part to improve, it would be necessary that a) he left the script more detailed, so that we could have a clearer view of the process and with that more conditions to follow it, monitor it to know if what was promised was fulfilled in the right way, etc. b) it would be essential for him to provide us with some partial results, that is, ways of verifying whether the small goals were being progressively achieved. The way this part of the proposal has been described, we really don't have a way to properly monitor the progress of the project. Now, talking about the auditability of the final results, the proponent tells us in a very abstract way what is intended here: “success in this project would be to build a working system that cures and promotes successful catalyst projects to promote the Cardano ecosystem. In addition, it increases available developers for the Cardano ecosystem.” This information is already given in the impact part, it would be necessary for the proponent, once again, to indicate objective ways to understand if the platform was in fact a catalytic space, exchange of experiences and mutual help between those involved. We would need quantitative data (eg how many developers are using the platform, how many projects have left it, etc.) and also qualitative data (how was this project beneficial not only for Cardano, but for India? What were the measurable consequences for the public? target? How did they benefit?). All this information should also reach the members of the Cardano community in a clear way.

      "In theory this proposal meets the objectives of the challenge, but in practice I do not believe that this is done so clearly. The present challenge aims to finance projects that involve our blockchain, in order to popularize it, increasing the number of investors, Dapps, NFTs, Ada being bought and etc, while helping developing countries to prosper. These goals are identifiable in the proposal, because the proposer wants to create an application that, through blockchain technologies, can raise financial funds for government candidates in Haiti who are in favor of science, progress and capitalism. This seems to be great, as certainly candidates with this mindset would help the country to prosper both economically and in terms of human development. However, I identified two problematic situations in the proposal. The first would be in relation to Cardano. It is not explained, at least in the impact part, how our blockchain technologies would be used in building the Dapp. Would investments be made in Ada? Would financial transfers be through smart contracts? It is not clear how this project would benefit our ecosystem, which is one of the pillars of this and all challenges. The other question is about the political part of the thing: we, from outside Haiti, don't know the political scenario very well, so we can't understand exactly the problem that is being faced and what proposals from the candidates that this Dapp would support. It would be necessary for the proponent to summarize what has happened in recent years in the country, to have attached some reports, so that we could have a more informed opinion about the changes he is supporting. I would also like to know who are these candidates who would promote the changes, their proposals, what ideologies they work with (we know who the thinkers the proponent aligns with, but not those of the candidates). In general, I think it's a little uncertain for us who are outsiders both what is happening and the changes that are being suggested and how this Dapp works within Cardano's technologies. Therefore, I am not sure that this proposal will be of high impact, which makes me need to suggest that the proposer reformulate his proposal, including more details. \n",

      "The viability of the project is not good, unfortunately. Starting with the absence of a roadmap, the proponent claims that in 3 weeks after funding the Dapp would be operational and accessible to everyone. But what would the process of creating this Dapp look like? It would be necessary for him to detail what small tasks would be necessary for him to go from idea to a reality. The time of 3 weeks in my opinion is very short, compared to the other proposals, both for this challenge and for the Dapps and applications, all projects take about months to be ready. It would be necessary for the proponent to explain what would be done in the first week, by whom, how, in what order. We would need to understand all the technical parts involved here, how design and programming professionals would work together in order to deliver the intended results. It would be necessary for him to explain what would be built little by little each week. As described, it is not possible to reliably understand what the development process of this application is like. Regarding the budget, 45k are requested and that are explained in a very superficial way. 15k would be reserved for the proponent, which according to him would support him for an entire year in Haiti. 10k would be reserved for his team, which raises the question of why 15k would be needed for just one person, while a lesser amount would be shared for several. We don't know how many people would make up this team, what their salaries would be, how long they would work, what their duties would be... I can't understand if this amount of 10k is fair; at first it seems to me disproportionate that a single person has a higher salary than several together. He asks for 20k for marketing, but again, there is no detail on how this amount would be spent, what the marketing campaign would be developed, why this investment would be necessary, how the Dapp would be publicized, we don't know what its characteristics would be as a brand ( colors, UI/UX design and etc). In other words, regarding the budget, we were also unable to understand exactly what would be paid and why this amount of financing would be necessary. And in relation to the team, this part is even more complicated, the author says he will hire other professionals to develop the project, but we don't know who they would be, what they would do, how many there would be. We do not know who the team would consist of, and for us to have confidence that the project will be successfully executed, it would be necessary to know who the team members are in detail. This included, in addition to their names and professional positions, how they would act on the project as well as a small resume of what they have done so far, so that we could get to know them well. \n",

      "The proposal is not auditable, the proposer informs us that his plans are to have a voice in the government and to build a better developed country, with more economic opportunities and so on. But how can this advance be measured and monitored? The proponent lacked details such as: number of innovative proposals that he and his team would launch; how they would help the local population (for example, if they worked on the renovation of a hospital, school, if they promoted improvements in the nutrition of needy students, in short, what changes were established in favor of the Haitians); which scientific projects they promoted; etc. That is, direct ways of perceiving this advance, we know that they intend to promote a change of scenery, but what indicators would be used to understand if this was real? Regarding the process, it's not easy to monitor the progress of a project where we don't have a sense of what the work schedule would be like to build Dapp. I suggest that this script be created, detailing what activities would be done each week, which professionals would be working in which phase, how the project's dissemination/marketing phase would take place, etc. That way, we would have material to check, you know? It would also be necessary for the proponent to establish direct contact with the community, providing feedback at each time period. This would be interesting not only for the process of creation and expansion of Dapp, but also for us to know its achievements with the local government, to understand the partial results, how, little by little, the change would be becoming a reality. Therefore, I think that this part of the proposal also needs a new elaboration, in order to give us more tangible material to be audited. \n",

      "In my sincere opinion, unfortunately this proposal does not make much sense for the purposes of the challenge, as the idea here is to promote a series of events and meetings between people who already have some involvement with Cardano, in order to expand the connections between them. and captivate greater enthusiasm for the technologies relevant to our ecosystem; however, this is not done on a specific community basis. In summary, that was all I could absorb about this proposal, because I didn't define more details such as: where these meetings will take place; approximately how many people are expected to participate in each of them; which specific subjects within the thematic axes of the Cardano ecosystem will be addressed (for example, an introduction to Cardano could explain what blockchain is, what cryptocurrencies are, the basic differences between Cardano and other blockchains; while more in-depth topics could discuss how to propose in catalyst, how to program smart contracts, study about Plutus and etc). I think the nature of these meetings is too abstract, the proponent states that he attended the Cardano Summit 2021 in Berlin, and that he intends to continue promoting these events. But little is understood what they would be like. And in relation to the alignment with the challenge, from what I understand we are here seeking to finance projects that talk about a very specific target audience, groups that have their own cultural characteristics, which must be respected, also have unique linguistic characteristics that must be targeted. in the preparation of the proposal. This proposal, on the contrary, aims to expand something that already exists, to several cities, that is, several audiences, not focusing on a particular group. An example that I last evaluated in this same challenge is the proposal “French Haskell + Plutus Curriculum”, in which the idea was to translate knowledge about Cardano’s own programming language into French, and the target audience was African speakers of that language. Notice the difference? It doesn't mean this idea is bad, it just doesn't fit well for this particular challenge. In my opinion, it would make more sense for her to be submitted in the challenge of the new members on board. Therefore, unfortunately I will give a low grade, I would like the idea to be better broken down so that I could have greater clarity on how these events would be, and that it be submitted in the challenge that I mentioned earlier, so that the alignment would be greater and consequently the impact as well. was more accurate. \n",

      "The feasibility of this proposal is low, we have very little information about script, team and budget. Starting with the script, we don't know anything about how the first date will play out. Would it be necessary to know what activities would be part of the pre-production, if there would be speakers being hired or if it would really be something more informal, in which location in Berlin, specifically, would it be an art gallery or an NFT market? How many people are expected at this inaugural meeting and how would it be possible to get in touch with them? Would there be some kind of record of what was happening? Neither is described about how the event would be organized, nor what would happen in it itself. In addition, we would also need to understand what is to come. Where would the next meetings be, who would organize them, through what activities, how many people are expected, what subjects would be addressed? All this information should be described with great accuracy and richness of detail, being established phases, the phases related to months of the year (for example, in phase 1, actions would happen in hypothetically May, June and July). The activities of each month should be explained, as well as small deadlines to be respected within that time interval and also who would do what. Now talking about the team, we are not presented with any team, all we are told is about the proponent, who claims to be “a pioneer of cardano and in touch with an NFT streetart gallery”. Right, but what would his name be, how does this person relate to our blockchain, what is his professional background, what examples of work inside and outside our ecosystem he developed, is he a linkedin through which you can check all the information you ask? It would be necessary for him to attach a small professional resume, as well as the rest of the participants, it is clear that this project would be developed by a team, as it is not possible to organize meetings individually, but it is not said how many people would be hired, what they would do , what are their CVs and so on. So this part is also quite incomplete. And finally, $10,000 is asked, and the amount is not justified in detail, which is said that $6,000 would go to a number of things (artists, speakers, drinks, and the first venues hosting Cardano community gatherings) ; ideally, the proposer would explain how this 6 thousand would be distributed to each of these parts, how many hours the artists and speakers would work, what drinks they intend to buy, what places they intend to rent... And the other 4 thousand would be destined for advertising and marketing, but we don't know how this publicity campaign would be, where it would be done, through which strategies and so on.

      "I disagree with what is said in the following excerpt: (the proposal) “will be easily measurable by the number of events we organize, the people we attract, the local Cardano Projects we help build”. We do not know how many people are expected at each event, nor what people the proponent seeks to attract or what types of local projects they intend to target. In reality, no small goals are set, so I really can't identify how we would auditability of this project in relation to the development process. My suggestions are that the proponent draws up a roadmap with well-defined activities, related to very precise time intervals, so that we can find out what is being done, and measure whether the right thing is being done at the promised time and by the agreed people. Also, in addition to tasks, it would be important for the proponent to suggest specific goals to be achieved gradually. And it would also be necessary for him to establish frequent contact with the Cardano community, so that we are situated on what is happening. This bridge can be drawn in many ways, on telegram channels, video calls, email and the like. Regarding the final results, we know that the successful scenario would be to “establish a large local community, with regular meetings (every month), potentially at some point with a permanent space in a cafe/gallery to allow people to come and hang out. inform”; but how can we believe that this has been achieved? I would like the proponent to be more specific about how this big goal could be audited little by little, give us smaller indications to see the overall success. And, in the same way, it is necessary that such information reach the members of the Cardano community in a clear way. As I said, there are several ways to establish this contact, it is enough for the proponent to focus on what he thinks is most suitable for the project and actually get in touch with us. Unfortunately, it is a very unaudible proposal, I think that the reformulation of the script and the establishment of gradual milestones to be reached (in other words, partial results), would be a good way to make this monitoring more possible. \n",

      "This proposal is extremely ambitious, the objective here is to promote a worldwide change in the way of doing business, profiting and dealing with the economy. The proponent wants to create a series of DAOs that aim, in addition to promoting their activities and making a profit to their participants, to share part of the profits, generating a greater sense of equality and charity, as I understand it. He wants people to understand and practice the concept that the crypto world goes far beyond the desire to get rich, it is a humanitarian mission that aims to change the way the world works today. This, in theory, is perfect, it fits with the objectives of the challenge, which are basically to fund projects that can act as mentors for the populations of the developing nation, helping them on several fronts: health, education, employment, etc. In theory, the present project varies this, because it aims to create groups that would help each other and the people around them, giving financial assistance through profit sharing. This would also be good for the Cardano ecosystem, because, although this is not so explicit and well explained, DAOs are organizations that carry out their financial transactions on the blockchain, so it can be inferred that these groups would use Cardano ecosystem technologies to work, helping to popularize and expand our blockchain, benefiting it if it once again aligns with what the challenge calls for. Although everything is, in theory, very good, I think that this proposal has a big problem, which is precisely the lack of detail on how this would all happen. The goal is immense, extremely ambitious, so much so that the proponent says he intends for the first DAO to have at least 1 million participants (that's a lot of people, even if he helps boost that number through his company, we don't know how many people do part of it and what fraction of that total number would be incremented). We don't know how many DAOs he wants to create, how he will attract people to form them, he doesn't explain how he would educate people about blockchain and especially about the Cardano ecosystem. It also doesn't explain the nature of these DAOs, what kind of activities would be carried out in each of them, how they would be profitable, how exactly this profit sharing would happen - that is, how many % of the money and how this would be distributed (the donation money would be shared equally among the partner DAOs, a part would go to the population of the countries where these DAOs operate, how would that be?). We also don't know in which exact geographic location these DAOs would act, anyway, I think a lot was promised, at a very high cost of 200k dollars, and it wasn't detailed how this mega project would be put into practice. No, my opinion is not very valid that the theory of the proposal fits the objectives of the challenge if in practice this is so uncertain, if the day-to-day view of the project is not clear. Therefore, I suggest that the proponent reject the detail and amount of money requested in their project, so that it becomes more viable for our community to fund. \n",

      "The feasibility of the project is not very good in my opinion and I will explain why. Of the 3 parts, only 1, the script, is well explained, still not ideal. The script is divided into phases, numbered by letters (phase A, B, and so on). In each phase, the proponent explains what activities would be developed, what would need to be completed so that the phase is considered complete and people can move on to the next. It's not detailed how long each phase would last (he only talks about it in phases A and B, which are expected to last 6 months each). It is not described how long each task would take approximately, in this way, our script is very abstract: we know what should happen according to the phases, but there is not enough accuracy to understand, for example, how long each thing would take, so there is no solid understanding and visualization of the process. Some activities of these phases should be better detailed, in order to have a deeper understanding. For example, in phase A, activity 3: “in order for the majority of members to agree on decisions, a consensus mechanism is necessary”. What kind of consensus mechanism? This is very important to understand. This case is repeated with other activities, for example also in phase C activity 2: “employees will work 40h/s”. How can we already determine at this point the number of hours of work needed if we don't even know what these DAOs would be about, if each type of DAO would have a different need for working hours and that would also vary according to the performance of each professional. I find it a little unfeasible to establish a strict rule for something that is still undefined, we also don't know what the availability of people who are interested in these DAOs would be, for example if I want to participate in one but I can't promise 40 hours a week of work because I have other occupations, will I not be able to participate in the project? Is there no middle ground? I really believe that for a huge project like this it would be more interesting to go little by little, I could suggest that instead of asking for 200k of investment and already defining the phases and their tasks with such specificity, it would be better to ask for much less money and propose first phase, testing and seeing how things would work before we move on. The other two parts are quite insufficient, the money requested is not adequately explained, percentages are assigned to each part, but each part of these is very high and needed a very detailed detail to justify the need for such funding, we would need understand its use, if it would be good and fair and etc. This part a lot to improve. And about the team, I also think it is not adequate because we only have the proponent as the right professional, who does not present himself in a very complete way, I would like to know more about his resume, that is, what is the name of this sports company that he is owner? How can we measure your experience and relationship with the technologies relevant to the Cardano ecosystem? It is very risky to finance such an expensive project without a team already defined, complete and well presented. We don't know who the others are and so there's no way we can trust them if they're prepared for the tasks to come. \n",

      "This part of the project is unfortunately very superficial and inadequate, but again, let's break it down. Starting with monitoring the proposal: how can we understand that it is being developed properly if there are no parameters to be followed, there are no specifications on how to monitor activities, etc.? The author of the proposal claims that he will use “project management tools to ensure that all deadlines and requirements are met”, but what are these tools? Are they enough to track the progress of all the variables included in this complex project? How could we have access to such information? It would be essential for the proponent to better explain what these tools are and how they would work in practice, he could also cite in examples how the auditability proposed by him would be in the daily life of his project. The way he proposes the monitoring of this project is very abstract, unfortunately. Through the detailing of the phases, it would be possible for a member of the Cardano community to follow the development of the situation, that is, if the promised tasks were actually being done on time, in the right way and by the right people, and if the partial results were being obtained (and what they would be). This information should be taken to the rest of the community, but as it is a project of such breadth and complexity, I think it would be more appropriate if the proponent and its future team prepared reports at least monthly and sent them to the rest of the community, as a way of to prove the good progress of the project. The notions of success are also very abstract, it would be necessary to elaborate clearer objectives, both numerical statistics to be achieved (beyond the 1 million people in this first DAO) and qualitative objectives, such as KPIs, which could assess whether the project would be positive for both the Cardano ecosystem and the people and communities involved in DAOs. \n",

      "This proposal aims to mint on the Cardano blockchain various information about the “various conditions of the winemaking process and storage of different bottles” (of wines). Some characteristics to be monitored would be the temperature of the drinks, the storage conditions, the traceability of the location of the wines from their manufacture until they reach the final consumer, the imitation of the product (that is, if it is an original wine or a copy and etc). The problem pointed out by the proponent is that in the same production, different bottles of wine have different flavors, so wine connoisseurs could have more control over all the variables involved in the production, storage, transport and sale of wine bottles. This proposal would also be interesting for wineries, as they would also have better control over the units they would store and sell. It's an interesting idea, the wine market is really strong, but I have some observations to make. I think the target audience for this campaign would be a little limited, because generally those who consume more expensive and special wines are a portion of the richer and more mature population. In other words, young people are generally not that appreciative of wine, to the point of wanting to handle all the information about a specific bottle they are consuming. And it is usually young people who use blockchain technologies. I don't want to generalize or base my opinion on prejudices, but I'm starting from the observations I've made so far, both regarding the most active cryptographic community (young people) and consumers of more special wines (older people with greater purchasing power). I believe a fully monitored bottle of wine would not be cheap. In conclusion, I think the audience that would consume these wines would really be these richest people and who probably don't have as much familiarity with blockchain, so I think it would be important for the proponent to explain very well about what Dapp would be like in terms of experience. of user. It would need to be intuitive, with a well-studied UI/UX design, so that the target audience of the wine market that is probably not so used to blockchain could learn relatively quickly and simply the technologies that would involve Dapp. I think it would also be interesting for the proponent to tell us where this project would be launched in the first place, I believe in Europe or the United States, where the population has better purchasing power and also where blockchain technology is already more widespread. I think the idea can be very promising for Cardano, in fact it is original and it is a very large market (of wines), but this user experience issue should have been better explained, for what I said that probably who would consume these wines would be the typical profile of a person active in the cryptographic world (I'm not saying that this is a rule, but just a probability). If this issue had been explained, I think we would have a lot of security on how this project would be beneficial for Cardano, how a Dapp would be created that would attract new members to our community, increasing the number of transactions on our blockchain and the volume of Ada in circulation, for example. \n",

      "I found the activities described in the script to be somewhat superficial. The temporal division is very satisfactory, the proponent defines in weeks what will be developed, if the activities were better detailed I would find this part of the proposal ideal. For example, the “Market and Stakeholder Research - 2 weeks”; How would this market research be done? Would stakeholders also be surveyed? How would they be contacted? What would be the research methodology? What kind of results are they looking for? In this other part “Defining DApp borders - 2 weeks;” I would like to know what are Dapp borders and how they will be defined (who will define them and from what concepts). In other words, I cannot have a good view of the process because I believe that the activities reported are still very vague, so in my opinion it is necessary for the proponent to detail them better. Now talking about the budget division, the amount of 35 thousand dollars asked is quite high considering that only one phase will be covered with this fund. How many phases will there be and how much money would it be necessary to invest for them to be completed? The explanations of the parties are also superficial, for example, the project manager is asked for 10 thousand dollars, but we do not know what tasks he would do to manage this proposal, nor if he would work every day of the week on this project, if his workload would be full or partial; that is, we were unable to define the value of your working hour, so it is not possible to ascertain whether the requested value is fair or in excess. The same doubts are pending for the sales representative and the designer, we only know the total amount that is requested but not how many hours they will work. So I think it would have been better if the bidder had explained this information more carefully. About the team, we only know the name and role of the professionals involved (eg Stefan Vlaev - CEO); we don't have a resume attached, we don't know examples of past work, nor how they relate to Cardano, whether they are active members of the community or not... All this information is necessary, even if they have attached linkedin profiles, a little explanation should have been made available in the proposal itself. Therefore, I think that all topics (budget, roadmap and team) only provide the basics for us to have a general sense of the project's feasibility, I do not agree that this information has been provided with the appropriate level of detail. \n",

      "The information provided about the process audit is, in my view, final metrics, and doesn't really fit in with monitoring the Dapp build itself. A few things we do know is that the proponent intends for around 100K users to be on Dapp during the first year, for it to gather a revenue of $100K and for the trusted information to be on the blockchain for a period of 5 years. But notice how this all says about a post-Dapp release moment? How can we follow the production of Dapp itself, the activities that would be carried out by the designer, the programmer, the project manager? I think it's necessary for the proponent to rethink this particular topic so that it outlines measurable ways for us to track the entire Dapp development process. I think the most appropriate and straightforward way to do this is by reporting, I usually suggest they are monthly, but as the proponent breaks down temporality into weeks on impact, it would be great if the reports were weekly as well. They could contain a small summary of the activities that were carried out that week by the professionals, that is, if they properly fulfilled their working hours and did what was promised; it would also be important that these reports contain the partial results, the small goals achieved each week, for example. They could be made available to the Cardano community through any of our means of communication such as telegram and discord. Now talking about final results, unfortunately the proponent copied and pasted the same KPIs mentioned for the measurement of progress, so this part is quite inadequate, since we don't have new metrics to follow to understand if what was desired was achieved. Two things would need to be analyzed here: both the success of Dapp itself, which can be seen by the metrics established by the proponent, and the impact of all this for the Cardano ecosystem. In what explicit ways did this project help to expand our blockchain, was a new audience introduced to Cardano technologies, did these people somehow get involved with our blockchain by becoming active members of the community? Even if it's just the first phase of the project, it would be essential for us to understand how all this affected Cardano, so we could verify if the direct objectives of the challenge were really addressed. Therefore, I think auditability is inadequate, we only know ways to track results (and not the work of professionals involved in building Dapp); and we have no thought-out way to see how success was achieved in relation to Cardano. I suggest that the proponent re-evaluate this topic, giving us more detail. \n",

      "This proposal would be good if it explained what the project has to do with our blockchain. The idea is to promote awareness campaigns in four different communities in a country that was not clear to me, so that people would clean the facades of their homes. This certainly aligns with the objective of benefiting a location (but we don't know if it would be a developing country, as is the objective of the challenge), because with the cleaning of collective urban areas, the quality of life of the community's residents would certainly be positively impacted. . In this sense, probably less parasites such as cockroaches, rats, etc. would appear in the localities, improving public health, and the social sphere would also benefit in the sense that leisure spaces would be better preserved. However, all of Catalyst's challenges are also intended to benefit the Cardano ecosystem, whether through the creation of new digital wallets, an increase in the purchase and delegation of Ada, new CNFTs being minted, bought and sold, new participants in Catalyst (either as proponents, CAs or vCAs), new Dapps being developed, etc. None of this is mentioned here, I really didn't understand how this proposal would benefit the Cardano ecosystem. As much as it is environmentally advantageous, and in this challenge we want to benefit a community in some arbodement, be it in the scope of health, education, environment, etc.; the project would also need to make sense for our blockchain, it would need to help expand and popularize it. Therefore, unfortunately, I will give it a low score, it would be positive if the proponent reformulated the impact of this proposal in order to clarify, after all, what would be Cardano's gains in this context. \n",

      "The information contained in the script part is basically the same as in the impact, and is quite repetitive. Basically in all communities the same would be repeated: “Public education for one week followed by cleaning on Saturdays for four consecutive times (4 weeks)”. What would this public education look like? Who would teach? What content would be taught? How many people does the proponent expect to participate in these teaching sessions? Where would this happen, in schools, public spaces like squares? How would people in the community be captivated to participate in this movement? And in relation to cleaning the spaces themselves: how many people would work, for how long, in which exact locations (how many facades do they intend to sanitize)? Anyway, the activities are described in a very superficial way, it is not possible to understand with specificity how these movements would happen. It would be necessary for the proponent to answer all these doubts, explaining the minor details and placing them according to the passage of time. We know that activities in each community would last for 4 weeks, but what would happen in the first, second, and so on? The script, in my opinion, should contain a very specific division of time, for example, in the first week there would be an opening meeting of the project, where person X would address Y topics, for a certain amount of viewers, with certain marketing strategies, to call public attention, etc. I really think that part of the script is superficial and leaves something to be desired. Regarding the budget division, I think the money requested is quite high for the nature of the proposal, although the parts were explained well. We know exactly how the 21,000 dollars would be used, mostly to buy and rent cleaning supplies and accessories (clothing) for the action's volunteers. So, on the financial side, I don't think there's much more to go into. And finally about the team, this part is not good, we are only informed about the names and main roles of the duo that would be responsible for the project. But we don't know what they've done so far in their professional lives, examples of previous work and especially how they relate to Cardano. What are your experiences with our blockchain, how can we trust that you are prepared to successfully develop this project?

However, by the way it is said, we are not sure if the two of them (the professionals presented in the feasibility) would do this, or if they would delegate this task to third parties, what exactly would happen here? In my opinion, it is fair that the proponents themselves prepare these reports at the end of each work cycle, that is, every 4 weeks. It should contain not only how the volunteers' work routines were, but also how the collective education process took place, any problems faced throughout the process. These reports must be forwarded directly to the Cardano community, through the means of communication that the proponents prefer, such as discord, telegram, Town Hall, etc. And regarding the final results, we have two very direct indicators: “inhabitants fully committed to cleaning their environment / Having the necessary logistics for the cleaning exercises”. In addition, it would be necessary to understand the impact of these cleanings on communities, if the environment was really positively affected, what changes were observed, how people started to relate more to these environments after the cleanings, in what way this all benefited the Cardano ecosystem and etc. It would be necessary for all this data to be gathered in a final report, in my view, in the case of this proposal, a written document would be enough to evaluate the final scenario, of course, if the team and some volunteers held a small meeting to discuss what was generated from the idea and make the video available to the rest of the community would also be great. However, only the elaboration of a very complete and detailed document on how the project reached the communities, both the people, the environment and our blockchain, would be good enough. As well as the reports every 4 weeks this larger one must be sent to each member of the Cardano ecosystem, either by email, by the telegram group “Project Catalyst” or different means of communication between the community. I will give it 3 stars because I think so, some relevant metrics were suggested, but this was not properly explored. \n",

      "Unfortunately, this proposal does not fit the challenge and I also think that it is not a safe project to be financed by Cardano, even if submitted to a more suitable challenge. I will explain my opinion. The project is about creating, as the authors conceptualize a “platform integrates third-party applications, merchants, online e-commerce stores and famous staking engine.” In short, it would be an application to carry out financial transactions in cryptocurrencies, built on the Cardano blockchain. So far so good, it would be a big project using the technologies of our ecosystem, which is a positive point. Content, two things strike me as a problem here. To begin with, at no point in the proposal do the authors mention India, as this project could help, especially its population. The objectives of the present challenge are to promote projects that help the inhabitants of India, whether through increased interaction between the inhabitants of India and Catalyst, proposals submitted by Indians, dapps being built by them, etc. Will this platform have any focus on Indian users? Are the team members native there (from what I've seen, no)? So I don't understand why it was submitted in this challenge, it would make more sense if it was launched in the Dapps challenge, for example, where we seek to fund applications that use our blockchain to promote innovative ideas beneficial to people and to Cardano. Another point that worries me is that this platform, despite being built on Cardano, would facilitate transactions in several currencies, as stated in the proposal, including Ethereum, a very strong currency. In a way, we have to focus on Ada, our pools, the plutus developers and everything that says about Cardano only, and not benefit other cryptos and blockchains. Do you understand that I don't think it's worth it for Cardano to fund something that will ultimately help other cryptocurrencies to expand? Because of these problems, I think the proposal is not a good option for funding, at least in the way it was presented and in the challenge of India. \n",

      "That part of the proposal was presented very inappropriately, unfortunately. Starting with the script: there is no schedule to be followed, we don't know what the phases of the project would be, what would happen at each stage, which tasks would be done per month, by whom and how long they would last. For this part of the project to be satisfactory, he would need to provide this script. At one point in the proposal he says this phase of the project would last 4 to 6 months. What would happen each month? How long would these things last? Without a roadmap, we have no way of understanding the process of developing and building this project; therefore, this part of the proposal is overlooked. There is also no explanation of the funding requested, it is an extremely high value, 150k, we would need a very detailed explanation to know what is the need for so much money. This amount should be detailed as follows: informed of the salaries of the professionals involved (from what I saw there is only 1, but I will comment on that in a moment), how much would go towards other expenses such as legal licenses, marketing, etc. And each part of that should be very well detailed and justified in order to argue the amount of 150k. As we are told, we don't have any information about this part and that makes it very complicated to bet such a high amount on uncertainties. And finally, speaking of the team, as I said, there is only one person in the team description, which would be the bidder himself, which is extremely worrying. How would one person be able to carry out a project of this size alone? Due to the complexity, I would like to know how this professional would perform all the tasks necessary for the success of the project without anyone's help. It is more than necessary for him to establish a complete team, delegating activities based on their backgrounds. It would also be necessary for him to present himself better, there is not much confidence in his connection with the Cardano ecosystem, I would like him to talk about examples of previous work and prove this through some linkedin profile, for example. The rest of the team would also need to be properly introduced; ie their names, roles in the project, a small CV and how they relate to Cardano. Therefore, unfortunately the viability of this project is very low and needs a total revision. \n",

      "The proponent does not give good coverage on how to analyze the project. He doesn't set specific goals to be achieved, what he says in the notion of success are similar to what we read in the impact part, for what purpose this application would be created. For this part of the proposal to be satisfactory, it would be necessary that: direct and easy-to-measure goals were established, so that we could verify the notion of success quantitatively; more subjective but not abstract goals, such as the impacts of this project on the Cardano ecosystem, in order to carry out a qualitative analysis. Due to the complexity and technical nature of the project, it would be appropriate for the proponent to establish direct and constant contact with some members of the ecosystem who are from the areas of knowledge involved in developing the project. Through this contact, partial results could be analyzed and disseminated to the Cardano community. It's not enough to analyze the results, in my view, we also need to monitor the project development process, as this one doesn't have a schedule, it's also very complicated to do that. If a roadmap was detailed as I explained in the feasibility topic, we could follow the progress of steps, the development of tasks and so on. So unfortunately this is yet another topic that I will give a low grade, I suggest that the proponent review their evaluation, considering my observations and also those of other CAs who evaluate their proposal, so that it is more suitable and more valid to be funded on Catalyst. \n",

      "Unfortunately, the impression I got when reading this proposal was that the proposer promised something very good but didn't explain how he will deliver on it. It is said that “a vote is a new way to present ideas, topics and vote. By using Cardano and Prism, we can change the world as we know it.” Okay, but how does this differ from the way we already vote, via the Catalyst voting app? It is said that the problem at hand is a lack of trust and that “there is no easy way to reach a fully reliable consensus outside the chain”. I disagree with this... The Catalyst voting app is very easy to use, I've never heard of distrust and I've been on Catalyst for a lot of backgrounds. I think the proponent does not explain how this Dapp would be built, what this “broad-spectrum structure would look like and can be used anywhere, from the internal decision-making of a small company to the nation-states”... in short, nothing is said about the practical part of this initiative, how this evolution of what already exists would happen, what would be changed, what would remain, how would it be done so that voters would have more confidence in the process. I disagree that this proposal is interesting to be funded, all the issues I cited should have been properly clarified. I do not agree that the proposal is aligned with the objectives of the challenge, it is not understandable how this application would increase the number of active members in our community; nor, how would it promote increased investment in Ada; we don't know how the idea would contribute to the highest number of transactions on Cardano's blockchai; in short, all the minor objectives of the project are not met in a direct and palpable way here. In other words, to summarize my opinion, the proponent should have explained how the promises he makes would be fulfilled and how this would clearly impact the Cardano ecosystem. Note: I read the slides that were attached, they are very well built, but they still haven't clarified the doubts I mentioned. The idea is good, yes, but the explanations should be greatly reinforced. \n",

      "The script of the proposal is extremely superficial. It is explained which activities would be developed over the course of 3 months, which I believe is the total project development time. We know that in month 1, “team training: database engineer, systems engineer” would be done; but shouldn't that already be ready by the time the proposal is submitted? In other words, shouldn't we already know who the people are before we fund the project, so that confidence in their ability to successfully execute the jobs is conveyed? In the second month, all we are told is that “research and development” would be done; perceive that the proponent does not detail the activities that would be carried out? We know what would be done, but not how it would be done. For this part to be ideal, it would be necessary for us to know how this research would be developed, what topics would be researched, what methodology would be used, how contact with the target audience would be made... Regarding development, the same thing: it would be essential to know how the development of the application would be carried out, in fact this is the part that would need to be better detailed, since it would consist of several activities, carried out by several professionals, and represents the heart of the project. Anyway, the script should be much more detailed. About the budget, the same thing happens; we are informed in a very basic way about expenses, for example in “Research and Development: with the team: 1 month. 2 developers $8000”. Would each developer receive 4,000, that is, would this amount be shared equally between the duo? How many hours of work would they devote to the project? About building the MVP, why would that cost $24,000? How would this high amount be distributed over the 3 months of work? All parts should be better explained, the way this part of the proposal is presented, we really don't have a good visualization of how the money would be spent. Finally, talking about the team, we do not have the basic information about each team member, namely: the name of each professional involved, a description of their professional resumes, an explanation of how they relate to our blockchain, their profiles from linkedin where we could have proof of the information given... In short, trust is not passed on to the team, since it is unknown to us. Finally, I think the feasibility of the project is very low and needs to be completely reworked, so that all topics are presented in detail. \n",

      "The proposer tells us which milestones would have to be reached during the development of this proposal, some of them (finish the system design and architecture and develop the backend database and integrations) are related to a time frame of 1 and 2 months , respectively. However, the ones he reports later are not indicated according to any passage of time, being “develop conceptual GUI interface (...)” and “build APIs and fork resources”; how can we know until when these tasks should be accomplished? Other doubts I had about auditability are: first, it is said that meetings would be held so that the monitoring of activities would be constant, but would these meetings only be with the IOG coordinators? Would these contents be accessible to the Cardano community as well? Another question I had is regarding the “night checkpoints”; What would that be? Anyway, I think that the proponent already guides us well in relation to the auditability of the process, but does not provide all the information necessary for us to fully understand this. Now about the final results, this part is much more vague, we know that success would be considered by “adoption by people, companies and governments around the world who want the security of a blockchain consensus”; but how can this be measured? How can we outline objective, measurable and direct ways to verify this scenario? It would be necessary for the proponent to have informed statistics and analyses, both qualitative and quantitative, that would allow the Cardano community to be able to confidently verify that the great objective has been achieved. It is necessary that we have direct ways to understand the consequences of all this for our blockchain, understand if the smaller goals of the challenge were accomplished, and also how all this would reach the knowledge of the Cardano community (which means of communication would be adopted between the team and the community ). So I think the feasibility was going well in the process part, only a few details were pending, but when talking about the success scenario, what is suggested is still quite vague. \n",

Speaking of impact, the idea itself is a good one, it's about taking cryptocurrencies to charities. However, nothing is explained in the scope of the proposal; on the attached slides (more specifically on the “product overview” slide we have a little more details on how the application would be developed and some of its features, such as that a marketplace similar to those that already exist for the sale of NFTs will be developed, but here only “only registered charities (or their designees) can coin content”; we also know that “the amount of content created will be limited, to create a true scarcity” (what do you mean? I didn't understand what the team meant by that) ); and also that “anyone can sign up for an account to buy NFTs on the site.” How will people find out about this project? knowledge about the cryptographic world? It is not clear either in the scope of the proposal or in the slides how this project will benefit Cardano in particular. We do not know if our blockc hain would be used (it is inferred that yes, because the proposal is in the financing fund of the company that founded Cardano); We don't know if the only cryptocurrencies that will be accepted will be Ada, nor do we know if future users of this application will be encouraged, in any way, to become active members of our community. In short, we basically don't know what we would need to know to ensure that the impact sought in this challenge (funding projects that do not fit into other challenges but are beneficial to Cardano) would be done properly.

I really think that all the information on the slides should be here in ideascale, but anyway, I think what is said there is still quite superficial about the script. We know what has already been done (Form governance body + Register as a non-profit + Build Cardano node for coinage) and what is still in progress (Become recognized as a public charity). Apparently, the team already has a good part of the project developed, and they don't explain where they would apply the 50 thousand dollars requested. What do they intend to do from now on is to become popular? From what I could understand, this application would be aimed at the United States, so I believe that the team wants to become known there and that the charities that would benefit would also come from that country, but it would be important that these doubts were resolved. . It would be essential for the proponent to explain what would be developed from now on, in which phases, how many months the process would last and what activities will be carried out according to each month. Speaking now about the requested funding, the proponent claims that the explanation will be on the slide, but it's not. We would need to know why they want 50 thousand dollars, how this money will be divided into parts, what the salary of the professionals involved will be, and so on. Unfortunately, we are out of budget information. The team is explained in the slides, we know the names, professional roles and linkedins of the professionals involved. I think this is the part that is better informed, we just need to know how these people relate to Cardano.

Would this person audit the process? It is like? How could we follow the work routine of the professionals involved, know if they fulfilled the promised hours each day, how can we know if the partial results would be delivered within the agreed time interval? Anyway, as I said, to know how to audit, we would first need to know what to audit. Therefore, the first thing that would have to be done to correct this problem would be to establish a detailed roadmap and then a detailed explanation of how the funding would be distributed in parts. Second, it would be necessary for the proponent and his team to prepare reports, at least monthly, with updates on the project, that these documents be analyzed in meetings with the IOG coordinators and also shared in a simple and direct way with the community. The proponent claims that the success scenario would be to help those in need; but unfortunately this is already a fact that we know from the beginning of the presentation of the idea. How can we know if people who need help have really been supported? Information that is needed here 1) define who would be helped 2) how they would be helped 3) that institutions maintain contact with the community, providing direct feedback on how this project has benefited them. It is also essential to understand how all this was beneficial for Cardano, after all, it would be 50 thousand dollars invested. What would be the payoff for our blockchain? How could we find out that more people are buying Ada, transacting on our blockchain, trading our CNFTs? How do you know if new active community members have been added?

We know it's about making the cryptographic environment more secure, and he's already tested this integration in \"projects near and far to use and test as we integrate communities.\" But what projects would these be? How near and far? We are measuring the distance of what? In what ways were projects made safer with the technology developed by the proponent? We know that the objective of the project is to create “Secure chat channel integrations for use by projects in the ecosystem”, however, it is not explained in an accessible and detailed way how this would be done. What was lacking in this proposal was, in fact, deeper explanations about the activities that will be developed; these explanations would need to be accessible to all readers of the proposal, that is, the language used should be simpler than what we currently find describing the proposal. Ideally, everyone could fully understand what would be done; even though some technical details would inevitably have to be explained in technical language, the general idea must be conveyed so that the CAs, vCAs and Catalyst voters fully understand what the bidder wants to convey. Otherwise, only a more limited audience, working with technology, would be able to understand the proposal. In general, my opinion on the impact of this proposal is that it cannot be adequately measured for the aforementioned reasons (lack of explanations in general and also because the present explanations are written in a way that is somewhat inaccessible to everyone). If such corrections were made, we would be able to better understand if the proposal is in line with the objectives of the challenge, which are basically to promote the construction of Dapps that are beneficial to the Cardano ecosystem, that increase the number of members of our ecosystem, promote the purchase and delegation of Ada, as well as the commercialization of CNFTs and other statistics that point to the greater popularization of our blockchain. \n",

It really just says that the work is started and that it comes to deliver a great process, however this does not point us at all about what has already been done, what will come next and how long it would still take for everything to be ready. Ideally, he would divide the total time into small parts, eg months; and that each month he would inform which activities would have to be done, and detail each one very well, in the sense of knowing: what would be done, by whom, how long it would last and how it would be done. It is necessary that we have knowledge about the work routine of everyone involved in the project. Therefore, unfortunately, this part of the proposal is totally insufficient. Now talking about the budget, a very high amount of $112,000 is asked. This money is also not satisfactorily explained, basically it is divided into two parts: the salary of the professionals involved (each one would receive 5090 ADA, with a total of 22 people) and other things like “servers, ip, domain, stakepool, moderators” , educators”. Let's go: how much time would each professional dedicate to this project? As we are told, we do not know the price of their working hours, so there is no way to define whether the amount that was chosen as a salary is fair. We have no idea if the project would only take a few months or about 1 year to complete, so we don't know if the 5090 ADAs requested would be for a short or long time of work. Regarding other things, we don't know how much would go to each (how much would be spent for servers, for moderates, for educators and etc). It would be necessary for the proponent to inform what values ​​are needed for each small part and to argue why this investment would be necessary. That is, the monetary part of the proposal also leaves much to be desired. Finally, about the team, we basically don't have information about each of them, all we know are their names and contacts (emails, and @s that I assume are from instagram). It would be necessary for us to know what roles each of them would play in this project, what their areas of training, examples of previous work and how each one relates to the Cardano ecosystem.

At first, it would be essential that a script be prepared. That way, we would have a basis on which to audit. We would know which activities should be developed in each time interval. With that, we would have goals, partial results to be achieved. It would be necessary for the proponent to define these issues and then maintain constant contact with the Cardano community, in order to provide us with regular feedback on the development of the project in practice. This could be done in several ways, such as monthly meetings with some members of the Cardano community, in order to pass on the main updates, if there were problems/challenges to be overcome that month, how they were solved and etc. Or, instead of synchronous meetings, reports could be prepared, punctuating advances in topics, and these would need to be made available to the community, either through discord channels, online tools or by email, for example. Now speaking of the end results, again we only have a very abstract scenario being represented: “give people and users a safe place to chat using end-to-end encryption”. Right... we know that this is the main objective of the proposal. However, how can we verify that the applications developed here were delivered completely and properly, if something was missing? How can we measure how security of chats has really improved? How has all this impacted the Cardano ecosystem? It lacked the proponent to define more objective and practical ways of how success would be perceived, in addition to determining what success would be. Therefore, it is necessary that these corrections are made, I really cannot see how this proposal can be easily audited because, in addition to not having a good auditability traced, we do not know details either about the final product or about its construction process. With that, unfortunately I suggest that this topic is also completely reformulated, in order to give us a more palpable and clear way of how to audit the project. \n",

      "This proposal is very confusing, it does not outline a project in itself, but rather promises a variety of ambitious actions, without secure planning and measurable objectives. The proponent claims that web3 is the future and that it will launch a series of projects, brands, businesses and etc that will make a lot of money. He also claims that he will clarify for the masses what blockchain, web3 and etc is, so that people understand and adopt the technologies of our ecosystem. I think this proposal has many serious flaws. Starting with the fact that we do not have an objective that can be reached based on a series of activities, which would linearly constitute the development of the project. Many different things are promised, like making the digital revolution “Web3 Blockchain Apps” a reality; “we will provide the latest Blockchain media/travel/publishing/encryption/music stores without censorship and we will build the best UBER/BOOKING/AIRBNB” and etc. Which stores would be provided? How would it be provided? The proponent wants to make various economic branches relevant to Cardano's technologies, as he says at the end of the impact ”We decentralized Travel/Media/Music from the global entities and offer a new reward for the use of our platforms blockchain.” But at no time is it clarified how. There are many different things, I think it is better to outline an initial project, well planned, containing steps to be followed; challenges to be mitigated (the proponent defines as a challenge that he is not of the field of technology, which is very worrying, because how does he intend to carry out a technological revolution without being in the area?); this project should also contain an objective s more specific. Instead of wanting to transform the general scenario, the proponent could focus, for example, on one of the areas mentioned, such as transport (he mentions uber). It would be interesting for him to suggest a Dapp that works in the area of ​​locomotion, through payments in Ada, using smart contracts, making people create digital wallets, in short, in general, that they know and adopt the technologies relevant to our ecosystem. Rather than saying that it will introduce the cryptographic world of web3 to the masses, the proponent could have provided some palpable plan on first raising awareness of a target audience, so that the concepts would then be more widespread. He would need to explain what would happen, how, who would do it, when and by what specific objectives the project was being guided. Unfortunately, the proposal as a whole does not present an action plan, it does not align with the challenge because it is not clear what would be done to improve Cardano; therefore, I will unfortunately give the lowest score for the impact. \n",

Regarding the budget, the proponent states that ideally 5 million dollars would be needed to achieve its objectives (but it is not explained why). He asks for 500 thousand dollars, which represents all the money that is destined for this challenge. In my view, just because of that, the proposal is economically unfeasible, I don't think it's a good idea to spend the entire treasure on just 1 proposal, especially not being a very well structured project that results in very clear and positive impacts for Cardano. Regarding the requested money, it is not explained in which parts it would be divided, we also do not have details about the parts (they are not made explicit). It would be necessary for the proponent to make it clear which professionals would be involved in the project and how much they would receive in salary, and how much the different aspects of the project would cost, such as marketing, design, programming, etc. Ideally, the salaries of professionals should be specified to the point where we know the value of their working hours. Anyway, this part of the proposal is also confusing, the proposer talks about several things, several investments, as we can see in the excerpt “I am seeking US$ 11.1 million against 49% equity/revenue participation as a co-founder of your group”, but none of this is very clear or related to the $500,000 request. Finally, when it comes to the analysis of the team, unfortunately in the proposal only information about Sébastien Staub. We know in which professional area he works, but not if he has any kind of relationship with Cardano, if he is an active member of our community, examples of his previous work, etc. It would be important for him to have attached his linkedin profile so that we have a working knowledge of the cited information. He attaches a website where we can see his work partner called “The Nazman”. We also have some information about it, but we don't have any examples of previous work and apparently it doesn't have any direct relationship with our blockchain either.

      "The auditability of the progress is quite confusing, the proponent claims that Dapp downloads (which Dapps?) will be monitored. He also says that “We will do this as a community and with CA” what will they do? And why would it be like a community/CA?. “But it will be for UA and UX/UI” what does that phrase mean? Unfortunately, I couldn't understand the message he wanted to get across. For the project development process to be plausible, the first thing that should be defined is a main objective, a well-planned and structured project, as I mentioned earlier. Then, a roadmap well backed up with dates and with a lot of detail should be provided, so that we would have something to base ourselves on when we were going to monitor the phases. It would be necessary for the proponent and his working partner to keep the Cardano community always up to date on the progress made in the phases, on the small goals achieved (ie partial results), as well as on how their work routines were being carried out. This monitoring would need to be constant, in my opinion, at most monthly updates should be kept. The information can be passed through written reports, or short videos, a brief slideshow, in short, the format and platform on which it would be made available is at the discretion of the proponent, it could be a website, the community's discord channels or any other online platform easily accessible to all members of our ecosystem. Speaking now about the success scenario, the proponent claims it would be when “the Cardano blockchain powers the top 10 DApps and the 5 billion users use our Web3 solutions and domains.” What 10 Dapps are these? 5 billion users is a very ambitious number, in my opinion, I would like the proponent to have outlined more tangible ways to see if the expected final results were obtained. I disagree that it is clear how all this will reflect for Cardano, it would be necessary to measure measurable metrics, both qualitative and quantitative, that could demonstrate in a proven way what were the benefits of this proposal for Cardano, if it managed to meet the specific goals of the challenge, if new people have joined the community as active members who buy Ada, CNFTs, delegate in pools, use Dapps, participate in Catalyst... Anyway. I think that, like the other topics, auditability is not well defined, and I cannot understand how this proposal could be monitored and how its fruits could be measured. \n",

       "'I consider the proposal is aligned with the objectives of the proposal.  It is consistent with the current state of the donation management system in many developing countries, lacking transparency and with many empty spaces for corruption and loss of faith on the part of donors.  Every fraud in the donation distribution system is one less donor and therefore, one more young person without access to education.     Zug is the Silicon Valley of blockchain technology, if there is a place to socialize one of the best tricks in the Cardano hat is there.  The proponent\\'s pre-established contacts together with some extra help from the Cardano Foundation with its offices in Zug, could achieve something interesting.   It\\'s a commendable fight. It’s clear the alignment of the proposal with the objectives of the challenge “Nation Building Dapps”. According to the information provided, the proponents are a European university institution recognized for their educational mission to provide university level education to students from developing countries.  Africa, Asia and Latin America have been their geographies of work.  Under the tutelage of the IOG itself, they teach one of the most important topics for Cardano as an ecosystem: Haskell and Plutus. \\n\\nBeing a business school, they seek to take students from the acquisition of theoretical knowledge to direct interaction with the real world: finding employment, developing their own projects, getting involved with the growth of their communities, seems to be the bet that the proponents make, with a track record that seems to support their experience in the area.    \\n\\nIn my opinion, if an educational institution functions as a knowledge platform that dynamically seeks to involve young people and students in general with the economy of their communities (either through other companies or through their own projects), is an organization that not only can provide its students with the legitimate right that every human being has to make their life a better life, it can mean the creation of a gateway to more activity in our ecosystem, to a more widespread use of our technology, and in the end, an important boost to the price of our sometimes unfairly beaten native token ADA. In my opinion, these are the most important point in the proposal relative to Impact:\\n\\n-They have a case. Basically, opportunities for pricing arbitrage (taking advantage of differing prices for the same asset - for our situation, counterfeit - ) increase when there is an inefficient market. And, when the inefficient market is not in one sector, it is throughout the economy, fortune serves to smile on a few at the expense of the vast majority.  The proponents seek to clean up the system by making the supply chain more transparent in one of the heaviest sectors of the national economy: construction, starting with the cement supply chain.  If they make any headway in the process, perhaps the results will be very interesting and applicable to other sectors of the local economy and the various economies of the African continent. \\n\\nSustainable Development Goals of the United Nations that are directly at stake (as a contextual exercise):  \\n\\n(8) Decent Work and Economic Growth, (9) Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure,(16) Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions\\n  The proposal understands the current state of Catalyst\\'s governance system.  The proposal is good at identifying the current pressure points.  However, as a CA and vCA I wonder how their reputation and digital identification systems will influence the anonymity of the CA\\'s work needed to generate impartiality and randomness.  Given that in any decentralized organization its Governance system is the essence of participation and decision making, to first develop tools and then coordinate their implementation with the community is quite disturbing in a process that should go in the opposite direction: first the socialization with the community and then the development of the tools. Fun and games as components of a learning strategy are valuables, but I doubt the extent to which monetary rewards will strike a deep chord in the minds of learners in a meaningful and lasting way.  Money is not immortal in the minds and souls of students, only in their greed and basic instincts.  No matter how much money you pay a lump of coal to become a diamond, it is not going to do it for the money.\\n\\nOn the other hand, economic rewards as a tool to engage in academic activities is a topic that should be subject of research.  However, the problem is: the market smells the money,  and wherever there is activity, it will be there.  And I doubt I want my children around when education, economic rewards and industry are all in the same room. I know, I know, maybe my culture is different and my country does not have the problems of the proponents\\' country (in reality, it\\'s not the case), but the sure thing is: the market does not care our origin. It is what it is. \\n\\n\\n I know the Yoma project.  Nicky Hickman was one of the personalities invited to one of the FireSide chats of the Atala Prism Pioneers. From that FireSide, in which Nicky talked about Yoma, I started to study a little more about the project. And the conclusion never changed: it is a beautiful project. In addition to its purpose, it makes a clean connection between stakeholders, roles, technology and the system that communicates it all.  It is a well-oiled machine.  When a young person enters your network, they have no choice but to come out the other side as a better version of themselves. \\n\\nThere is no doubt that the integration of the Yoma project into our ecosystem is of great benefit to us, just as there is no other ecosystem that understands the purpose of Yoma better than Cardano.  \\n\\nSo, after reading all the material provided in the proposal, including the attachments, I am surprised that there is not a more thorough and rigorous explanation of the process of integrating the Hyperledger Aries/Indy stack with Atala Prism.  It is not difficult to establish the alignment of the proposal with the goals of the challenge and with building better communities.  Putting the proposal in context, in one way or another the proposal will impact each of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and that is simply because the Internet access it will provide opens the door to education and interaction with the outside world. It opens the door to possibilities.  Easy and practical technology in the hands of people living in remote and socially, economically and geographically difficult areas. I agree, what is argued by the proposal can do the job.  In my opinion, the proposal is closer to identifying and working around a business opportunity in the real state sector rather than key aspects of the Nation Building Dapps challenge such as poverty or foundational registration.   Things like the creation of a landowner registry seems to be a solution to a logistical problem and not a contribution to the reduction of poverty indicators or to the legitimization of land ownership rights. \\n\\nPutting the situation in context, if we look at the proposal through the eyes of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, we can see its lack of focus on objectives such as the End of Poverty or Sustainable Cities and Communities.  But, don\\'t get me wrong, as a commercial and business opportunity, the proposal has its merits.  Not only is the proposal aligned with the objectives of the Nation Building Dapps challenge and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, if one reads the proposal carefully one realizes their willingness to dive into the depths of the problem they wish to address.  Their victory will mean a better world for all.  A triumph for the human spirit. \\n\\nBased on the proposal, it could be stated that they know how to attack the monster (for ex. “On-board high school students at final examination centers”) and that they have a long-term view of benefits (for ex. \"Identification at a young age allows a user to build a credit history or any other reputation-based assets\").  Also, the proponents put in the battlefield of the proposal the Cardano ecosystem, so for better or worse, as a community we will be involved (it is not a secret that many proposals seek mainly funds for their own projects and want to keep Cardano away from the action and why not say it, from the benefits).  \\n  In my opinion, these are the most important point in the proposal relative to Impact:\\n\\nNo doubt about the link of the proposal with the objectives of the challenge. An external player connecting the different actors (community, universities, government) under the strategic action suggested by the proposal can be a serious obstacle in the fat, careless, unconscious and exploitative way of life of those actors at the individual level (typical tragedy of the commons).  \\n\\nHarmful separately, they can create something beautiful if circumstances force them to work together on common ground.  The common ground described by the proponents can elevate the behavior of communities, universities and government around water as a non-fungible and finite resource.  \\n\\nSustainable Development Goals of the United Nations that are directly at stake (as a contextual exercise):  \\n\\n(6) Clean Water and Sanitation, (14) Life Below Water \\n The proposal proposes a partnership that can be mutually beneficial.  Collaboration between the two parties can result in individual and collective benefits. In my opinion, the proposal is closer to identifying and working around a business opportunity than to key aspects of the Nation Building Dapps challenge, such as contributing to the reduction of poverty indicators or legitimizing land ownership rights.    The proposal appears to be a solution to a logistical and networking problem. Putting the situation in context, if we look at the proposal through the eyes of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, we can see its lack of focus on any specific objective described therein.  But, don\\'t get me wrong, as a commercial and business opportunity, the proposal has its merits. The competitive advantage and differentiation of the proposal at market and social impact level lies in: \\n\\nThe team on board: the Loxe team, their skills and experience.\\nThe partners: Landano (Nana Safo, Peter Van Garderen, and team), the Homeless Hub proposal (Stephen Whitenstall, Vanessa Cardui, and team).\\n\\nBut in my opinion, the proposal is closer to identifying and working around a business opportunity in real estate than on key aspects of the Nation Building Dapps challenge like poverty or the foundational registry. The creation of a housing registry under the conditions described in the proposal appears to be more of a logistical and commercial solution than a contribution to reducing poverty indicators or legitimizing land rights.  As Landano partners (with their work in Ghana or Mozambique), the proponents should clearly distinguish the difference between the situation of legitimization of land rights and the Dapp for the Land Registry of their proposal.  My analysis is based on the information of the proposal and the website  https://www.aroyomatch.com/\\n There is no doubt that enabling mechanisms for citizen participation outside of any central control (but always within the framework of ethics) is fundamental in the development of societies.  However, lack of detail regarding the implementation and auditing process makes it difficult to fully understand the scope of the proposal.  At the same time, the proposal does not offer much explanation as to how it will bring ordinary people closer to its technology and its benefits.  Therefore, it is difficult to establish the true impact of the proposal in terms of scope.  According to the proposal, the work of CA/vCA is not a stage, it is a continuum that requires its own funding to exist as a body in the Catalyst governance system.  That would be a real Community Advisors improvement.  And of course, that improvement comes with commitments: they will have to show results of improvement in the CA/vCA sub-ecosystem. There is no doubt that countries like Sri Lanka would benefit greatly from a proposal like the one put forward by the proponents, because as we all know, education is the gateway to a better reality. Similar projects (for ex. Yoma   https://www.yoma.foundation/) are proof of effectiveness in the formation of a new class of educational system.   At the same time, the proponents put in the battlefield of the proposal the Cardano ecosystem, so for better or worse, as a community we will be involved (it is not a secret that many proposals seek mainly funds for their own projects and want to keep Cardano away from the action and why not say it, from the benefits).  I honestly believe that proposals like this are the beginning of better societies, they are the awakening of the dinosaur dream that the dinosaurs still in power want to keep intact.  The world has already changed, and it wants to be better.     In my opinion, the proposal has the potential of addresses mainly one of the most important environmental problems on the planet, especially in developing countries: the bad practices in the disposal of cellphones and electronic devices that increase the level of E-waste in the environment. Work around enhance the tech repairs supply chain can impact the natural ecosystem in a serious way, reducing the the levels of irresponsable polution caused by the consumer and the producer of electronic devices.   Unlike other forms of concertation, trade has the real ability to organize wills around mutual benefits and responsibilities.  Clealy, this proposal can impact the objectives of the challenges and the UN sustainable development goals (14) Life Below Water, (15) Life On Land. My recomendation to the proponents: focus the proposal more on that aspect, commit your work to that issue and speak to the community from that scenario. The funds and the technical support will follow you. Because, in its current state, the proposal is closer to identifying and working around a business opportunity in the services sector than it is to the key aspects of the Nation Building Dapps challenge and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\\n     No doubt about it.  One of the main tools of accesability to our ecosystem is the education. And this tool multiplies its power when it prioritizes doing over theory alone.  Gimbalabs knows well.  \\nAlso, the grade of involvement of the students in the process of teaching and learning described in the proposal is very powerful at knowledge building level.  The hands in the pie dough is the most effective learning technique. Creating markets is clearly aligned with the objectives of the challenge. However, I fear that the proponents do not fully understand the dynamics that govern what they wish to create.  Inclusiveness, the formation of better government institutions more connected to the real needs of the people, the formation of better educational processes when the application described for the proposal is applied in the classrooms, are characteristics of an initiative that can contribute to the achievement of the goals of the challenge and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. As a CA from a few funds back, I keep wondering how long it takes before a successfully funded proposal with a generous budget can access new funding. What requirements must it meet, what must it demonstrate, what checklist must it satisfy before aspiring to an equal or even larger sum, especially when such sums are risk-free for the grantee, free of drawdowns and with all raises included?  The proposal promotes the extensive use of SSI technology in its processes.  I believe it is in line with the objectives of the challenge. There is no doubt that the proposal aligns with the objectives of the challenge. The proposal describes a need that opens up possibilities for the ecosystem. I believe that the proposal is clearly aligned with the objectives of the challenge and with the objectives of the UN sustainable development goals.  The methodology and experience of the proposers can be a great contribution to the developing world in the education area. In my opinion, the proposal relates a situation that is really close to the current reality and that has prevailed for a long time without an alternative solution.  From this proposal I believe that Atala can be an articulating element in the construction of the knowledge acquisition history of any student on the planet, especially students from developing countries.  It is no secret that employers give more and more weight to the specific knowledge and skills acquired by individuals and less to the universities or institutions that certify those skills.  In my opinion, the proposal involves aspects that correspond to a case study where our SSI technology can demonstrate its scope (Registry of companion animals and their owners and how that registry can serve as an interoperable rights recognition tool).  Cardano as an ecosystem should confirm if such kind of project is already or was implemented in that area. If so, the proponent and the ecosystem itself should encourage the formation of a working team.   One of the main tools of accesability to our ecosystem is the education. At the same time, and according with the objectives of the challenge \"Nation Building Dapps\", education is the most powerful human platform with the enough reach for change the destiny of an entire Nation.\\n\\nEssentially, this proposal seeks to build an educational solution in which content is as important as access to it.  High-level education in the palm of people\\'s hands.   In general, the concept makes sense.\\n\\n\\n Citizen participation is key in defining the destiny of a nation.  The proposal attempts to establish a framework in which people as a community can define the variables that affect their existence.  However, I think the proposal is still too general with respect to threats and responses, the soul of its structure. Creating markets is clearly aligned with the objectives of the challenge. However, I fear that the proponents do not fully understand the dynamics that govern what they wish to create. In my opinion, the spirit of the proposal revolves around the establishment of a small knowledge laboratory of the Cardano ecosystem.  A knowledge center that people of all backgrounds could enter and openly acquire knowledge that would make their lives better.  The lab would be run by proponents with a long standing relationship with Catalyst and Cardano that remains active to date, with knowledge and experience in development and logistics (logistics: an ingredient from the  physical world in the mix). This small knowledge center could become the incubator seed for Cardano ecosystem projects in the Malawi community.  Thanks to the management of this knowledge lab, we could see among us new Catalyst members and new Cardano developers.\\n\\nIt is this kind of apparent low-scope projects that initiate a major reaction due their tendency to connect with other seemingly low-scope projects.  You don\\'t know where they came from but they end up taking the region they are in by storm. Classic guerrilla strategy.\\n\\nRecomendation for the voter: the answer to the question \"What does success for this project look like?\" in the Auditability section is almost poetry. A few lines that summarize the essence of Cardano. It could be thought that the character and social configuration of the community that the proposal proposes to address highlights its willingness to understand what Cardano and its SSI technology wish to share.  As an exercise it brings together the qualities of a project from which Cardano can draw valuable lessons at the level of social implementation. However, it is the conflict and difficulty that leads to the need to implement solutions.  It is the existence of old social structures that only generate benefit for a few that leads to the need to implement tools that level the playing field for all.  The republic of Uzupis has built something very beautiful that is taking its own path.  Our goal as an ecosystem is to contribute to improve situations, giving people the tools to create their own changes.  It is in these situations that our tools and collaboration end up being duly appreciated, valued and an integral part of people\\'s lives, as an organ that over time is surrounded by tissue and arteries to the point of becoming something difficult to remove.  Our guilty sin is not wanting to be irrelevant, accessories.  We want to be in the crossfire.  Therefore, I do not consider the Republic of Uzupis to be a conflict zone that wakes us up at night with nightmares about war.  No doubt the Consenz team has a good understanding of the purpose of Atala Prism and how Consenz and Atala could leverage each other.  The governance structure of DAOs is permanently on the table in the blockchain industry as an issue that needs to be improved.  Advances in the area would put us at the forefront and we could make a valuable contribution to the sector. In Colombia, land ownership registry is a huge social problem and one of the most important contributions to the poverty level in the country.   Provide security to the information collected through cadastral procedures is a serious thread to the corruption business.  Therefore, I consider that this proposal is aligned with the objectives of the challenge. In my opinion, the proposal would be a great development achievement worthy of other challenge such as Developer Ecosystem or Cardano Scalling Solutions. Of course, it would be a great support for many solutions in the current challenge, however, I think it corresponds to a more specialized category.    It is essential to reflect on the scope that SSI technology can have, by exploring the limits of what can be incorporated into people\\'s digital lives and at the same time be subject to interoperability.  In this exploration, the inclusion of aspects such as cultural roots opens the possibility of providing a more human identity to the digital identity that we want to incorporate at the SSI level.  Therefore, in my opinion, the proposal touches on an important issue.  At some point, the code and our need to incorporate our entire physical reality into a digital reality will have to meet in order to arrive at a viable solution.  The two sides will have to flex and contract to reach an agreement.   There is a possible recipe commercial hub that could represent an interesting service for the restaurant sector.  Recipes as tokenizable content. The proposal comes from concerned citizens who want to take an active role in improving the level of security in their community.  They do not want to be passive actors who watch as violence consumes their community and puts their loved ones at risk.  However, this proposal is still a work in progress.  The proposal touches sensitive nerves of the challenge, the UN sustainable development goals and the Cardano ecosystem itself. However, it is a proposal that is still in the process of being articulated.   The end of its journey promises to be something that will not go unnoticed. In my opinion, it is not its time. Creating markets is clearly aligned with the objectives of the challenge.  However, I fear that the proponents do not fully understand the dynamics that govern what they wish to create. And if they did, they would realize that it is not a good idea to walk through that door. This proposal is the scheme of a project that can contribute to make more dinamic the real state sector.  However, it tackles too much and grabs too little. Its level of depth is shallow.  But as a brainstorming document is excelent.  Signs of a restless mind behind it. The proposal clearly identifies the general problem surrounding the adoption rate of SSI technology.  However, it does not go beyond identifying the problem.  After reading it, my opinion is that the proposal has the fire but still lacks the structure to be effective.  Improving people\\'s access to real estate by fractioning assets into more accessible parts (tokenization) is a reality.  It is a process that is in its early stages of development, yet it is an idea that has already begun to drill into the minds of the market.  No player has yet fully developed the idea, although marketing and PR campaigns try to say otherwise.  Like almost everything surrounding the www3, we are in the midst of massive testing exercises, testing the limits we can reach along with the very consistency of those limits, stealing inches of space from the current physical reality until it feels cornered and forced into dialogue.  \\n\\nTherefore, I think that the proposal, in its intention to improve consumer access to a capital-intensive market, has its merits to be in this challenge. The proposal is aggresive in its mission.  A purpose of that magnitude can shake the playfield.  However, in its current state, it needs to develop a white paper. Creating markets is clearly aligned with the objectives of the challenge. However, I fear that the proponents do not fully understand the dynamics that govern what they wish to create.  In general, this proposal attempts to align with the objectives of the challenge.  However, in its approach it does not offer a significant advance over the work that other teams in previous funds have already advanced.  The three components described in the Impact section (mapping, overview, collaboration) promise to be addressed under the methodology already developed by previous proposals.  As is recurrent in most areas of study, consulting previous work by authors recognized for their contributions is part of the process of designing a project whose purpose is to provide progress.  Unfortunately, the proposal shows signs of going around in circles until its budget is exhausted.  Sounds great. Atala PRISM + Metaverse + Japan = this proposal really knows how to flatter a lady.   However, I\\'ve been talked out of my ear like that before.  The proposal offers no solid information about its beginning, development or possible endings.  Going forward there is only fog that does not allow to visualize neither the possibilities of success nor the possibilities of failure.  It does not talk about strategies or mechanics to go along the way.  The budget requested (10% of the total budget of the challenge) would clearly support two, maximum 3 teams with less fascinating proposals but clear in their purpose (interoperability, integration with other systems, etc).  The proposal speaks to the heart, but the brain does not receive the same electrical signals.    Undoubtedly, integration with the Sovrin Network is of importance to the Cardano ecosystem.  Interoperability is one of our strategic objectives. There is no doubt about the alignment of the proposal with the objectives of the challenge, but in my opinion, there is still some articulation work to be done in terms of profundization of concepts and structure.  In general, the proposal approaches the problem of improving the process of identifying participants in decentralized organizations.  However, it does not present a solution that demonstrates an understanding of the complexity of one of the most important issues at the level of DAOs and participation in Governance.  In my opinion, a little more research and interaction with teams at Catalyst and Atala Prism that are already working on the issue would improve their perspective of the problem.  It is a young problem that will be waiting for them when they return home. The proponents are legitimate representatives of the forces of good fighting against the cunning forces of evil.  After so many battles, so many fallen comrades, so much cruelty, we have learned that you don\\'t go to war against evil without a plan.  We have learned that when we have a strategy that can be improved along the way, the odds of beating the adversary a few feet at a time are on our side.  Until we push him to the edge, to the point of deciding whether to jump or join us, extinction or survival.  \\n\\nWe are the world\\'s opportunity, and it is a responsibility that requires extra effort from us.  It requires that we have a plan.  \\n\\nThe proposal proposes the fight, but its strategy is simply to put up the  face and see how far round it resists. Charities don\\'t need funds (mostly): they have the cause on their side and good people and organizations willing to provide the funds they require (more people than I would like to accept).   Charities know how to fight and they know how to play the game.  What they require is long-term strategies that allow them to hone their work, improve their skills, broaden their knowledge, extend their reach, transform themselves. What charities require less is charity: it\\'s better tools to do their job of taking care of all of us.  \\n\\n\\n\"Bright minds think alike,\" the saying goes.  At Catalyst it\\'s a credo.  Other teams are tracking the issues raised by the proponents.  One of them is the proposal team at F8 - DirectEd-Student Scholarship Portal (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/400027) whose purpose is aligned with that of the proposers and presents an organization that can give structure to their proposal. I recommend that proposers contact them.  Something of real value could emerge.\\n The proposal describes a community participation activity that could precisely awaken people\\'s sense of community. However, it does not articulate any long-term objective from which to deduce its contribution to the objectives of the challenge. Many unresolved gaps.   Proposal in early stage of development.  In process of construction yet.  However, a good idea. The proposal seems to be similar to a preview proposal in F7 (Based Travel Documents & IDs - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/381057) based on the same principles around the situation of the birth certificates/records of live birth. There is no doubt about the alignment of the proposal with the objectives of the challenge, but in my opinion, there is still some articulation work to be done in terms of concepts and structure.  There is no doubt about the alignment of the proposal with the objectives of the challenge, but in my opinion, there is still some articulation work to be done in terms of profundization of concepts and structure.  In my opinion, there is still some articulation work to be done in terms of profundization of concepts and structure.  There is no denying that the very construction and presentation of a proposal is a strenuous exercise, however, necessary to open clean communication channels with the outside world. Reading this proposal and comparing it with proposals from other teams with similar scope purposes, I clearly notice the importance of a structured proposal and the valuable time and effort that the teams invest in it, going beyond publishing quick sentences (not to be confused quick with clear, or concise or forceful) and word files whose content shows off their own cleverness.  Not only does the proposal not enrich the reader\\'s or voter\\'s experience, it certainly leaves them too dazed to continue their work and in need of a break.  Make the homework is part of the business of request funds.   An interesting unfinished proposal. The ingredients mentioned and the website describe a proposal with a very interesting potential.  It is a pity.'"
